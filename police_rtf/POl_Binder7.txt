GuidancePreparation and planning for emergencies: responsibilities of responder agencies and othersHow the government prepares and plans for emergencies,working nationally, locally and co-operatively to ensure civil protection in the UK.From: Cabinet Office (/government/organisations/cabinet-office)Published 20 February 2013The Civil Contingencies ActThe Civil Contingencies Act (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents), and accompanying non-legislative measures, delivers a single framework for civil protection in the UK. The Act is separated into 2 substantive parts: local arrangements for civil protection (Part 1); and emergency powers (Part 2).Part 1Part 1 of the Act and supporting Regulations and statutory guidance ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency-preparedness) establish a clear set of roles and responsibilities for those involved in emergency preparation and response at the local level. The Act divides local responders into 2
categories, imposing a different set of duties on each.Those in Category 1 are organisations at the core of the response to most emergencies (the emergency services, local authorities, NHS bodies). Category 1 responders are subject to the full set of civil protection duties. They will be required to:  assess the risk of emergencies occurring and use this to inform contingency planning  put in place emergency plans  put in place business continuity management arrangements  put in place arrangements to make information available to the public about civil protection matters and maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public in the event of an emergency  share information with other local responders to enhance co-ordination  co-operate with other local responders to enhance co-ordination and efficiency  provide advice and assistance to businesses and voluntary organisations aboutbusiness continuity management (local authorities only)Category 2 organisations (the Health and Safety Executive, transport and utility companies) are ‘co-operating bodies’. They are less likely to be involved in the heart of planning work, but will be heavily involved in incidents that affect their own sector. Category 2 responders have a lesser set of duties - co-operating and sharing relevant information with other Category 1 and 2 responders.Category 1 and 2 organisations come together to form ‘local resilience forums’ (based on police areas) which will help co-ordination and co-operation between responders at the local level. For more on what LRFs do and contact details for each, see the guide on ‘Local resilience forums: contact details’ (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-resilience-forums-contact-details).The bulk of Part 1 of the Act was brought into force in November 2005 (the duty on local authorities to provide advice and assistance to business and voluntary organisations about business continuity management commenced in May 2006).Part 2Part 2 of the Act updates the 1920 Emergency Powers Act to reflect the developments in the intervening years and the current and future risk profile. It allows for the making of temporary special legislation (emergency regulations) to help deal with the most serious of emergencies. The use of emergency powers is a last resort option and planning arrangements at the local level should not assume that emergency powers will be made available. Their use is subject to a robust set of safeguards - they can only be deployed in exceptional circumstances.
Part 2 of the Act was brought into force in December 2004.

This section outlines what we mean by emergency planning, different types of plans, the importance of exercising them and training key staff, and the kind of factors which planners should consider.What is emergency planning?Emergency planning should aim where possible to prevent emergencies occurring, and when they do occur, good planning should reduce, control or mitigate the effects of the emergency. It is a systematic and ongoing process which should evolve as lessons are learnt and circumstances change.Emergency planning should be viewed as part of a cycle of activities beginning with establishing a risk profile to help determine what should be the priorities for developing plans and ending with review and revision, which then re-starts the
whole cycle. Plans should focus on at least 3 key groupings of people - the vulnerable, victims (including survivors, family and friends) and responder personnel.Vulnerable people may be less able to help themselves in an emergency than self- reliant people. Those who are vulnerable will vary depending on the nature of the emergency, but plans should consider: those with mobility difficulties (those with physical disabilities or pregnant women); those with mental health difficulties; and others who are dependent, such as children.Victims of an emergency - which includes not only those directly affected but also those who, as family and friends, suffer bereavement or the anxiety of not knowing what has happened.Responder personnel should also be considered. Plans sometimes place unrealistic expectations on management and personnel. Organisations should ensure their plans give due consideration to the welfare of their own personnel. For instance, the emergency services have health and safety procedures which determine shift patterns and check for levels of stress.Organisations should aim to maintain plans which cover 3 different areas:Plans for preventing an emergencyIn some circumstances there will be a short period before an emergency occurs when it might be avoided by prompt or decisive actionPlans for reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency The main bulk of planning should consider how to minimise the effects of an emergency, starting with the impact of the event (ie their alerting procedures) and looking at remedial actions that can be taken to reduce effects. For example, theemergency services may be able to stem the emergency at source by fighting fires, combating the release of toxic chemicals or the extent of floods. The evacuation of people may be a direct intervention which can mitigate the effects of some emergencies. Recovery plans should also be developed to reduce the effects of the emergency and ensure long term recovery. The National Recovery Guidance (http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/national-recovery-g uidance) provides more detail on recovery issues.Plans for taking other action in connection with an emergencyNot all actions to be taken in preparing for an emergency are directly concerned with controlling, reducing or mitigating its effects. Emergency planning should look beyond the immediate response and long term recovery issues and look also at secondary impacts. For example, the wave of reaction to an emergency can be quite overwhelming in terms of media attention and public response. Plans may need to consider how to handle this increased interest.As obvious as it sounds, emergency plans should include procedures for determining whether an emergency has occurred, and when to activate the plan in
response to an emergency. This should include identifying an appropriately trained person who will take the decision, in consultation with others, on when an emergency has occurred.The maintenance of plans involves more than just their preparation. Once a plan has been prepared, it must be maintained systematically to ensure it remains up-to-date and fit for purpose at any time if an emergency occurs.It may be that multiple organisations can develop a joint emergency plan where the partners agree that, for a successful combined response, they need a formal set of procedures governing them all. For example, in the event that evacuation is required, the police would need carefully pre-planned co-operation from various other organisations such as fire and ambulance services and the local authority, as well as involvement of others such as transport organisations.Types of emergency plansIt may be important for an organisation to have more than one emergency plan. It is often the case that organisations have generic plans and more specific plans.Generic plans are the core plan which enables the organisation to respond to, and recover from a wide range of possible emergencies. They should include procedures which would be used in all instances for ensuring the welfare of staff and the provision of sufficient resources for responding to the emergency.Specific plans relate either to a particular emergency or kind of emergency, or to a specific site or location. Specific plans are a detailed set of arrangements designed to go beyond the generic arrangements when they are likely to prove insufficient in a particular case. A specific plan usually builds on a generic plan. For example, organisations which deal with hazardous materials may need specific plans for responding to a chemical spillage. Some organisations may have specific plans for conducting specific functions in response to an emergency. For instance, the emergency services will have plans for mass evacuation of an urban area and mass decontamination. Organisations should use their risk assessments to decide whether specific plans are necessary or desirable.Exercising plans and training staffOrganisations should test the effectiveness of their emergency plans by carrying out exercises, and should ensure that staff involved in the planning for or response to an emergency receive appropriate training. Training plans should also consider other people who have a role in the emergency plans such as contractors and civil protection partners. The plans themselves should explicitly identify the nature and frequency of training and exercising required. The guide Emerg ency planning and preparedness: exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and- preparedness-exercises-and-training) provides more information.
Emergency planning at the local levelEmergency planning is at the heart of the civil protection duty on Category 1 responders under the Civil Contingencies Act. The Act requires Category 1 responders to maintain plans for preventing emergencies; reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of emergencies; and taking other action in the event of emergencies. These should draw on risk assessments and should have regard for the arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public at the time of an emerg ency (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme#warning-and-informing-the-public).The Regulations require plans to contain a procedure for determining whether an emergency has occurred; provision for training key staff; and provision for exercising the plan to ensure it is effective. Procedures should also be put in place to ensure that the plan is reviewed periodically and kept up to date.Category 1 responders should involve Category 2 responders - and other organisations which are not subject to the Act’s requirements - as appropriate throughout the planning process. Category 1 responders are specifically required to have regard to the activities of relevant voluntary organisations when developing plans. The Regulations permit Category 1 responders to collaborate with other organisations in delivering the emergency planning duty.Category 1 responders also have a statutory duty to publish their emergency plans, to the extent necessary or desirable for the purpose of dealing with an emergency.Emergency planning at the sub-national levelPlanning at a multi-LRF level is different from planning at the local level. For more information on the sub-national tier, see the Arrangements in England (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-responsibilities-of-responder- agencies-and-others#arrangements-in-england) section.Emergency planning in the devolved administrationsIt is equally important that organisations within the devolved administrations conduct effective emergency planning. The devolved administrations section below provides more detail on the extent to which the Civil Contingencies Act duties apply and their individual emergency planning arrangements.The government works closely with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to promote effective emergency planning that is, as far as possible, consistent with that of the rest of the UK.Emergency planning at the UK government level
The UK government capabilities programme is the core framework through which the government is seeking to build resilience across all parts of the UK. The programme uses risk assessment over a 5-year period to identify the generic capabilities that underpin the UK’s resilience to disruptive challenges, and ensures that each of these is developed. These capabilities include dealing with mass casualties and fatalities, response to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear incidents, provision of essential services and warning and informing the public. A full list of the current capabilities can be found in this g uide to the capabilities programme (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme).The government has in place a coordinated cross-governmental exercise programme covering a comprehensive range of domestic disruptive challenges, including accidents, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. The programme is designed to test rigorously the concept of operations from the coordinated central response through the range of lead government department responsibilities and the involvement of the devolved administrations, to the sub-national tier and local responders. More information is provided in the g uide to emerg ency exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and-preparedness-exercises-and-training).These national processes feed into the devolved administrations, sub-national and local levels to ensure fully integrated emergency planning at all levels throughout the UK.The role of the voluntary sector in emergency planning and responseWhere appropriate, organisations should consider at an early stage in planning whether voluntary organisations may have capabilities which could assist in responding to an emergency.The voluntary sector can provide a wide range of skills and services in responding to an emergency. These include: practical support (such as first aid, transportation, or provisions for responders); psycho-social support (such as counselling and helplines); equipment (radios, medical equipment); and information services (such as public training and communications).Existing emergency planning dutiesThe Civil Contingencies Act Regulations identify 3 pieces of legislation pre-dating this Act which were introduced separately in Britain and Northern Ireland under sector-specific legislation operated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and HSE Northern Ireland. These relate to major accident hazards at industrial establishments (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (COMAH)), to hazardous pipelines (Pipelines Safety Regulations) and to radiation hazards (Radiation (Emergency Preparation and Public Information) Regulations (REPPIR)). These sector-specific Regulations have established multi-agency emergency planning regimes in co-operation with the operators. To avoid duplication, the Civil
Contingencies Act Regulations provide that the duty to maintain plans under the Act does not apply to emergencies which are dealt with by these pieces of legislation.For more information on how the Act fits with other legislation see chapter 19 of ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Important documentsEmerg ency Preparedness (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness)  Chapter 5: “Emergency planning”  Annex 5a: “Examples of generic and specific plans”  Annex 5B: “Generic plan: emergency or major incident”  Annex 5C: “Specific plan”  Annex 5D: “Example of a plan maintenance matrix for a local authority”Chapter 7 “Communicating with the public” - Contains further detail on communicating with the vulnerable and victims in an emergency  Annex 7A: “Communicating with the public: the national context “  Annex 7B: “Lead responsibility for warning and informing the public”  Annex 7C: “Checklist of suggested protocols”Chapter 14: “The role of the voluntary sector” Annex 14A: “Examples of voluntary sector activities in support of statutory services”  Home Office document Recovery: an emerg ency management guide(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recovery-an-emerg ency-management-g uide)  Communicating risk guidance(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/communicating-risk-g uidance) Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm) - a guide to emergency planning arrangements, risk assessment and other documentation is available on this website London’s strategic emerg ency plan (http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/london- prepared/home)Devolved administrationsThis section describes emergency preparedness and planning arrangements in the devolved administrations, where these differ from UK government and local
arrangements in England. It also outlines how Part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act and its associated Regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. More detail on the specific duties under the Act and how they apply in the Devolved Administrations can be found in chapters 2 to 8 of the guidance document‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Emergency preparedness in ScotlandIn devolved areas the Scottish government is designated as the lead on relevant issues in line with the ‘lead department’ principle at the UK level. In reserved areas the Scottish government works closely with the UK government to ensure that Scottish needs are catered for.Overall responsibility for civil protection policy in Scotland sits with the Scottish Resilience Division of the Scottish government.At the local level in Scotland, 8 strategic coordinating groups based on current police force areas promote effective planning for all types of incidents in their area, involving risk assessment, making generic and specific emergency plans, engaging with the community, training, testing, exercising and reviewing.  Scottish government civil emerg encies website(http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/public-safety/emerg encies)Emergency preparedness in WalesThe Welsh government (WG) or Wales Office, depending on the subject matter, is represented on relevant committees and forums within the UK government relating to civil protection. They work closely with UK government departments to ensure that UK civil protection policy and planning is tailored to Welsh needs. A dedicated team in WG supports multi-agency co-operation in Wales and engagement with the UK government on issues relating to civil protection and emergency preparedness.As in England, local resilience forums (LRFs) are the principle mechanism for multi- agency co-operation on civil protection issues. The respective Chief Constables presently chair the LRFs in the South Wales, North Wales, Dyfed-Powys and Gwent areas. The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi- agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum meets quarterly and is chaired by the First Minister or the Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration. Risk assessment at a pan-Wales level is undertaken by the Wales Risk Assessment Group (WRAG) reporting to the WRF.A number of other groups provide forums for discussion and co-ordination of civil protection in Wales, including: the Joint Emergency Services Group; the Wales Media Emergency Forum; and the Welsh Borders Resilience Group.
  Welsh civil emerg encies website (https://gov.wales/wales-resilience-forum)Emergency preparedness in Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) in the UK government is, however, responsible for, amongst other things, policing, criminal justice and security in Northern Ireland.The Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (CCPB) in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) promotes and co-ordinates civil protection arrangements in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland government would normally have oversight of civil contingencies arrangements for transferred functions. The ‘lead government department’ principle applies to Northern Ireland departments as at the UK level.The Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is a pan-Northern Ireland multi-agency forum for the development, discussion and agreement of civil protection policy. Co-ordination at local and sub-regional levels may be facilitated by a range of organisations, with police district commanders and district council chief executives taking key roles in co-ordination. Northern Ireland has its own unique constitutional and organisational structures. Unlike in Great Britain, many services are delivered on a Northern Ireland-wide (regional) basis, either by government departments or by their agencies and NDPBs.  Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch website(http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm)The devolved administrations under the Civil Contingencies Act ScotlandPart 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act applies to Scotland, with the powers it sets out residing with Scottish Ministers in line with the devolution settlement. While civil protection in Scotland is largely a devolved matter and therefore the responsibility of the Scottish government, certain responders in Scotland are subject to Part 1 of the Act, the Regulations and guidance issued by UK ministers - the Health and Safety Executive, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the British Transport Police.WalesThe arrangements set out in Part 1 of the Act apply in Wales. However, there are some differences in the requirements which the Regulations place on Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales because of the unique administrative arrangements in Wales. As in England, the principal mechanism for co-operation between Category 1 and 2 responders under the Act will be the local resilience forums (LRFs). The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi-agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum is a non-statutory advisory body.
Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The duties of the Act apply only to a limited number of organisations which deliver functions that are not transferred. These organisations are: the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI); the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA); and telecommunications operators. Because these organisations do not represent the full spectrum of response agencies in Northern Ireland, the Regulations treat these organisations in a slightly different way. In practice, it is anticipated that the PSNI, MCA and telecommunications operators in Northern Ireland will undertake their duties under the Act, but will relate to the other public service bodies listed in the Regulations in line with the arrangements in the Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework and by participating in Northern Ireland co-operation, co-ordination and crisis management machinery.Further informationYou can find further details on all of the above in these documents: ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: devolution concordat with Scottish Ministers’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act-2004-devolution-  concordat-with-scottish-ministers) ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: concordat between the UK government and the Welsh government’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act- 2004-concordat-between-the-uk-g overnment-and-the-welsh-g overnment) ‘Emerg ency preparedness - chapter 10: Scotland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61033/Chap  ter-10-Scotland-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 11: Wales’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61034/Ch  apter-11-Wales-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 12: Northern Ireland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61035/Ch  apter-12-Northern-ireland-amends-10112011.pdf)Co-operation for emergency preparednessCo-operation between organisations is fundamental to emergency preparedness. A large number of organisations will need to co-operate when responding to emergencies, so it is right that organisations co-operate closely in preparedness and planning as well. The government aims to ensure all organisations co-operate in emergency preparedness, and robust co-operation arrangements are in place at every level. This section outlines who should co-operate, and how. It describes co- operation arrangements in place locally and points out the emphasis placed on co- operation within the Civil Contingencies Act.
Who should co-operate?Organisations will need to co-operate closely with any other organisation who would be involved in responding to and recovering from an emergency which affects that organisation.That will mean not just partner organisations, but contractors, and voluntary organisations who may be involved in the response. Organisations should consider their need to co-operate with a wide range of public (for example, local authorities, emergency services), commercial (for example, other businesses) and voluntary organisations (like charities and voluntary response organisations).What co-operation?Every-day co-operation between organisations is the lifeblood of civil protection work- through visits and seminars, phone calls and emails, and joint projects including exercises.Many organisations are well used to co-operating in both preparing for and responding to emergencies. The emergency services, for instance, obviously co- ordinate closely when responding to emergencies. They also co-operate closely in policy and planning, and undertake joint training and exercises. Likewise, utilities companies have close links with local authorities and the emergency services.Organisations should aim to co-operate bilaterally and attend multi-agency groups and forums to discuss co-ordinated and sometimes joint approaches to the essential aspects of emergency preparedness - risk assessment, emergency planning, business continuity management, and arrangements to warn and inform the public. Such forums should also consider producing multi-agency plans and other documents, including protocols and agreements, and the co-ordination of multi- agency exercises and other training events.Co-operation at the local level under the Civil Contingencies ActThe principle mechanism for multi-agency co-operation at the local level is the local resilience forum (LRF) (https://www.gov.uk/local-resilience-forums-contact-details). LRFs are generally based on local police areas, and bring together all the organisations who have a duty to co-operate under the Civil Contingencies Act, along with others who would be involved in the response.The purpose of the LRF process is to ensure effective delivery of those duties under the Act that need to be developed in a multi-agency environment.Co-operation at the sub-national level
Some co-operation and co-ordination takes place at multi-LRF level in England, which brings together representatives of local responders, and is supported by resilience advisers from DCLG-RED (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies), to work together to address larger-scale civil protection issues.Co-operation at the devolved administration levelSimilar co-operation and co-ordination arrangements are in place in the devolved administrations. For instance, in Scotland strategic co-ordinating groups are similar to LRFs, and the Scottish Emergencies Co-ordinating Committee (SECC) provides co-ordination and determines the national strategy for the development of civil protection. In Wales the Welsh Government (WG) provides that co-ordination, and a Wales Resilience Forum brings together local responders and UK government bodies. In Northern Ireland the Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is the forum for the development, discussion and agreement of Civil Protection Policy for the NI public services.Co-operation at the UK levelGovernment departments who are responsible for contingency planning and response within their own areas (for example, infectious diseases falls to Department of Health; fuel disruptions falls to Business Innovation and Skills), work closely together. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) in the Cabinet Office co- ordinates their work to enhance the country’s resilience to the full range of emergencies.Central government works very closely with the devolved administrations, local authorities and emergency services. Officials attend the full range of multi-agency forums and regularly go out to visit practitioners.Arrangements in EnglandThe Department for Communities and Local Government - Resilience and Emerg encies Division (DCLG-RED) (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies) provides the platform formulti-LRF co-operation and planning in emergency preparedness where this would add value by improving co-ordination between local and central response. This section outlines the arrangements in England for emergency preparedness at this level.Co-operation at the sub-national levelCo-operation at the sub-national level in England is a key element of the UK’s civil
protection framework. The sub-national tier is not a judgement on the local level; rather, it is a mechanism for improving co-ordination and communication into and out from the centre of government.Co-operation at the sub-national level involves the representatives of local responders and central government bodies working together to address larger-scale civil protection issues. Co-operation may take place within a multi-agency setting or directly between 2 or more responders.Role of the sub-national tierThe function of the sub-national tier is to improve co-ordination and communication between central government and local responders and other organisations and to ensure that areas are prepared to respond to events which would affect most or all of the area or which could overwhelm any locality. The successful delivery of the sub-national resilience capability rests critically on local responders and other organisations and central government working together in partnership to ensure effective and co-ordinated planning and response.Opportunities to collaborate and co-operate at a multi-LRF LevelPlanning for and responding to large-scale emergencies cannot be done in isolation in each local resilience forum (LRF). Mechanisms for cross-boundary working and relationship building are essential as some emergencies will overwhelm localities’ resources and/or boundaries.Collaboration and co-operation between localities in England is a well-established and critical way of working in civil contingencies. It is a mechanism:  for enabling pooling of resources to achieve agreed mutual aims and outcomes  for avoiding duplication of work between neighbouring LRFs or avoiding activity by an LRF that may be counter-productive to a neighbouring LRF to support planning and exercising for emergencies that cross local resilience areas or which could overwhelm a locality  that enables individual responders, local forums and central government to work together to address large-scale civil protection issuesDCLG-RED works directly with LRFs, supporting collaboration and co-operation in planning for wide-area high-impact events affecting more than one locality. RED has allocated Resilience Advisers to each LRF so that LRFs have named contacts with which to build working relationships. For more information, see chapter 16 of‘Emerg ency preparedness’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61039/Chapter-16-final-post-consultCCS_amends_16042012.pdf) on collaboration and co-operation between LRFs.

GuidancePreparation and planning for emergencies: responsibilities of responder agencies and othersHow the government prepares and plans for emergencies,working nationally, locally and co-operatively to ensure civil protection in the UK.From: Cabinet Office (/government/organisations/cabinet-office)Published 20 February 2013The Civil Contingencies ActThe Civil Contingencies Act (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents), and accompanying non-legislative measures, delivers a single framework for civil protection in the UK. The Act is separated into 2 substantive parts: local arrangements for civil protection (Part 1); and emergency powers (Part 2).Part 1Part 1 of the Act and supporting Regulations and statutory guidance ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency-preparedness) establish a clear set of roles and responsibilities for those involved in emergency preparation and response at the local level. The Act divides local responders into 2
categories, imposing a different set of duties on each.Those in Category 1 are organisations at the core of the response to most emergencies (the emergency services, local authorities, NHS bodies). Category 1 responders are subject to the full set of civil protection duties. They will be required to:  assess the risk of emergencies occurring and use this to inform contingency planning  put in place emergency plans  put in place business continuity management arrangements  put in place arrangements to make information available to the public about civil protection matters and maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public in the event of an emergency  share information with other local responders to enhance co-ordination  co-operate with other local responders to enhance co-ordination and efficiency  provide advice and assistance to businesses and voluntary organisations aboutbusiness continuity management (local authorities only)Category 2 organisations (the Health and Safety Executive, transport and utility companies) are ‘co-operating bodies’. They are less likely to be involved in the heart of planning work, but will be heavily involved in incidents that affect their own sector. Category 2 responders have a lesser set of duties - co-operating and sharing relevant information with other Category 1 and 2 responders.Category 1 and 2 organisations come together to form ‘local resilience forums’ (based on police areas) which will help co-ordination and co-operation between responders at the local level. For more on what LRFs do and contact details for each, see the guide on ‘Local resilience forums: contact details’ (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-resilience-forums-contact-details).The bulk of Part 1 of the Act was brought into force in November 2005 (the duty on local authorities to provide advice and assistance to business and voluntary organisations about business continuity management commenced in May 2006).Part 2Part 2 of the Act updates the 1920 Emergency Powers Act to reflect the developments in the intervening years and the current and future risk profile. It allows for the making of temporary special legislation (emergency regulations) to help deal with the most serious of emergencies. The use of emergency powers is a last resort option and planning arrangements at the local level should not assume that emergency powers will be made available. Their use is subject to a robust set of safeguards - they can only be deployed in exceptional circumstances.

This section outlines what we mean by emergency planning, different types of plans, the importance of exercising them and training key staff, and the kind of factors which planners should consider.What is emergency planning?Emergency planning should aim where possible to prevent emergencies occurring, and when they do occur, good planning should reduce, control or mitigate the effects of the emergency. It is a systematic and ongoing process which should evolve as lessons are learnt and circumstances change.Emergency planning should be viewed as part of a cycle of activities beginning with establishing a risk profile to help determine what should be the priorities for developing plans and ending with review and revision, which then re-starts the
whole cycle. Plans should focus on at least 3 key groupings of people - the vulnerable, victims (including survivors, family and friends) and responder personnel.Vulnerable people may be less able to help themselves in an emergency than self- reliant people. Those who are vulnerable will vary depending on the nature of the emergency, but plans should consider: those with mobility difficulties (those with physical disabilities or pregnant women); those with mental health difficulties; and others who are dependent, such as children.Victims of an emergency - which includes not only those directly affected but also those who, as family and friends, suffer bereavement or the anxiety of not knowing what has happened.Responder personnel should also be considered. Plans sometimes place unrealistic expectations on management and personnel. Organisations should ensure their plans give due consideration to the welfare of their own personnel. For instance, the emergency services have health and safety procedures which determine shift patterns and check for levels of stress.Organisations should aim to maintain plans which cover 3 different areas:Plans for preventing an emergencyIn some circumstances there will be a short period before an emergency occurs when it might be avoided by prompt or decisive actionPlans for reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency The main bulk of planning should consider how to minimise the effects of an emergency, starting with the impact of the event (ie their alerting procedures) and looking at remedial actions that can be taken to reduce effects. For example, theemergency services may be able to stem the emergency at source by fighting fires, combating the release of toxic chemicals or the extent of floods. The evacuation of people may be a direct intervention which can mitigate the effects of some emergencies. Recovery plans should also be developed to reduce the effects of the emergency and ensure long term recovery. The National Recovery Guidance (http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/national-recovery-g uidance) provides more detail on recovery issues.Plans for taking other action in connection with an emergencyNot all actions to be taken in preparing for an emergency are directly concerned with controlling, reducing or mitigating its effects. Emergency planning should look beyond the immediate response and long term recovery issues and look also at secondary impacts. For example, the wave of reaction to an emergency can be quite overwhelming in terms of media attention and public response. Plans may need to consider how to handle this increased interest.As obvious as it sounds, emergency plans should include procedures for determining whether an emergency has occurred, and when to activate the plan in
response to an emergency. This should include identifying an appropriately trained person who will take the decision, in consultation with others, on when an emergency has occurred.The maintenance of plans involves more than just their preparation. Once a plan has been prepared, it must be maintained systematically to ensure it remains up-to-date and fit for purpose at any time if an emergency occurs.It may be that multiple organisations can develop a joint emergency plan where the partners agree that, for a successful combined response, they need a formal set of procedures governing them all. For example, in the event that evacuation is required, the police would need carefully pre-planned co-operation from various other organisations such as fire and ambulance services and the local authority, as well as involvement of others such as transport organisations.Types of emergency plansIt may be important for an organisation to have more than one emergency plan. It is often the case that organisations have generic plans and more specific plans.Generic plans are the core plan which enables the organisation to respond to, and recover from a wide range of possible emergencies. They should include procedures which would be used in all instances for ensuring the welfare of staff and the provision of sufficient resources for responding to the emergency.Specific plans relate either to a particular emergency or kind of emergency, or to a specific site or location. Specific plans are a detailed set of arrangements designed to go beyond the generic arrangements when they are likely to prove insufficient in a particular case. A specific plan usually builds on a generic plan. For example, organisations which deal with hazardous materials may need specific plans for responding to a chemical spillage. Some organisations may have specific plans for conducting specific functions in response to an emergency. For instance, the emergency services will have plans for mass evacuation of an urban area and mass decontamination. Organisations should use their risk assessments to decide whether specific plans are necessary or desirable.Exercising plans and training staffOrganisations should test the effectiveness of their emergency plans by carrying out exercises, and should ensure that staff involved in the planning for or response to an emergency receive appropriate training. Training plans should also consider other people who have a role in the emergency plans such as contractors and civil protection partners. The plans themselves should explicitly identify the nature and frequency of training and exercising required. The guide Emerg ency planning and preparedness: exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and- preparedness-exercises-and-training) provides more information.
Emergency planning at the local levelEmergency planning is at the heart of the civil protection duty on Category 1 responders under the Civil Contingencies Act. The Act requires Category 1 responders to maintain plans for preventing emergencies; reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of emergencies; and taking other action in the event of emergencies. These should draw on risk assessments and should have regard for the arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public at the time of an emerg ency (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme#warning-and-informing-the-public).The Regulations require plans to contain a procedure for determining whether an emergency has occurred; provision for training key staff; and provision for exercising the plan to ensure it is effective. Procedures should also be put in place to ensure that the plan is reviewed periodically and kept up to date.Category 1 responders should involve Category 2 responders - and other organisations which are not subject to the Act’s requirements - as appropriate throughout the planning process. Category 1 responders are specifically required to have regard to the activities of relevant voluntary organisations when developing plans. The Regulations permit Category 1 responders to collaborate with other organisations in delivering the emergency planning duty.Category 1 responders also have a statutory duty to publish their emergency plans, to the extent necessary or desirable for the purpose of dealing with an emergency.Emergency planning at the sub-national levelPlanning at a multi-LRF level is different from planning at the local level. For more information on the sub-national tier, see the Arrangements in England (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-responsibilities-of-responder- agencies-and-others#arrangements-in-england) section.Emergency planning in the devolved administrationsIt is equally important that organisations within the devolved administrations conduct effective emergency planning. The devolved administrations section below provides more detail on the extent to which the Civil Contingencies Act duties apply and their individual emergency planning arrangements.The government works closely with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to promote effective emergency planning that is, as far as possible, consistent with that of the rest of the UK.Emergency planning at the UK government level
The UK government capabilities programme is the core framework through which the government is seeking to build resilience across all parts of the UK. The programme uses risk assessment over a 5-year period to identify the generic capabilities that underpin the UK’s resilience to disruptive challenges, and ensures that each of these is developed. These capabilities include dealing with mass casualties and fatalities, response to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear incidents, provision of essential services and warning and informing the public. A full list of the current capabilities can be found in this g uide to the capabilities programme (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme).The government has in place a coordinated cross-governmental exercise programme covering a comprehensive range of domestic disruptive challenges, including accidents, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. The programme is designed to test rigorously the concept of operations from the coordinated central response through the range of lead government department responsibilities and the involvement of the devolved administrations, to the sub-national tier and local responders. More information is provided in the g uide to emerg ency exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and-preparedness-exercises-and-training).These national processes feed into the devolved administrations, sub-national and local levels to ensure fully integrated emergency planning at all levels throughout the UK.The role of the voluntary sector in emergency planning and responseWhere appropriate, organisations should consider at an early stage in planning whether voluntary organisations may have capabilities which could assist in responding to an emergency.The voluntary sector can provide a wide range of skills and services in responding to an emergency. These include: practical support (such as first aid, transportation, or provisions for responders); psycho-social support (such as counselling and helplines); equipment (radios, medical equipment); and information services (such as public training and communications).Existing emergency planning dutiesThe Civil Contingencies Act Regulations identify 3 pieces of legislation pre-dating this Act which were introduced separately in Britain and Northern Ireland under sector-specific legislation operated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and HSE Northern Ireland. These relate to major accident hazards at industrial establishments (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (COMAH)), to hazardous pipelines (Pipelines Safety Regulations) and to radiation hazards (Radiation (Emergency Preparation and Public Information) Regulations (REPPIR)). These sector-specific Regulations have established multi-agency emergency planning regimes in co-operation with the operators. To avoid duplication, the Civil
Contingencies Act Regulations provide that the duty to maintain plans under the Act does not apply to emergencies which are dealt with by these pieces of legislation.For more information on how the Act fits with other legislation see chapter 19 of ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Important documentsEmerg ency Preparedness (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness)  Chapter 5: “Emergency planning”  Annex 5a: “Examples of generic and specific plans”  Annex 5B: “Generic plan: emergency or major incident”  Annex 5C: “Specific plan”  Annex 5D: “Example of a plan maintenance matrix for a local authority”Chapter 7 “Communicating with the public” - Contains further detail on communicating with the vulnerable and victims in an emergency  Annex 7A: “Communicating with the public: the national context “  Annex 7B: “Lead responsibility for warning and informing the public”  Annex 7C: “Checklist of suggested protocols”Chapter 14: “The role of the voluntary sector” Annex 14A: “Examples of voluntary sector activities in support of statutory services”  Home Office document Recovery: an emerg ency management guide(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recovery-an-emerg ency-management-g uide)  Communicating risk guidance(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/communicating-risk-g uidance) Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm) - a guide to emergency planning arrangements, risk assessment and other documentation is available on this website London’s strategic emerg ency plan (http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/london- prepared/home)Devolved administrationsThis section describes emergency preparedness and planning arrangements in the devolved administrations, where these differ from UK government and local
arrangements in England. It also outlines how Part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act and its associated Regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. More detail on the specific duties under the Act and how they apply in the Devolved Administrations can be found in chapters 2 to 8 of the guidance document‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Emergency preparedness in ScotlandIn devolved areas the Scottish government is designated as the lead on relevant issues in line with the ‘lead department’ principle at the UK level. In reserved areas the Scottish government works closely with the UK government to ensure that Scottish needs are catered for.Overall responsibility for civil protection policy in Scotland sits with the Scottish Resilience Division of the Scottish government.At the local level in Scotland, 8 strategic coordinating groups based on current police force areas promote effective planning for all types of incidents in their area, involving risk assessment, making generic and specific emergency plans, engaging with the community, training, testing, exercising and reviewing.  Scottish government civil emerg encies website(http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/public-safety/emerg encies)Emergency preparedness in WalesThe Welsh government (WG) or Wales Office, depending on the subject matter, is represented on relevant committees and forums within the UK government relating to civil protection. They work closely with UK government departments to ensure that UK civil protection policy and planning is tailored to Welsh needs. A dedicated team in WG supports multi-agency co-operation in Wales and engagement with the UK government on issues relating to civil protection and emergency preparedness.As in England, local resilience forums (LRFs) are the principle mechanism for multi- agency co-operation on civil protection issues. The respective Chief Constables presently chair the LRFs in the South Wales, North Wales, Dyfed-Powys and Gwent areas. The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi- agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum meets quarterly and is chaired by the First Minister or the Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration. Risk assessment at a pan-Wales level is undertaken by the Wales Risk Assessment Group (WRAG) reporting to the WRF.A number of other groups provide forums for discussion and co-ordination of civil protection in Wales, including: the Joint Emergency Services Group; the Wales Media Emergency Forum; and the Welsh Borders Resilience Group.
  Welsh civil emerg encies website (https://gov.wales/wales-resilience-forum)Emergency preparedness in Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) in the UK government is, however, responsible for, amongst other things, policing, criminal justice and security in Northern Ireland.The Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (CCPB) in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) promotes and co-ordinates civil protection arrangements in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland government would normally have oversight of civil contingencies arrangements for transferred functions. The ‘lead government department’ principle applies to Northern Ireland departments as at the UK level.The Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is a pan-Northern Ireland multi-agency forum for the development, discussion and agreement of civil protection policy. Co-ordination at local and sub-regional levels may be facilitated by a range of organisations, with police district commanders and district council chief executives taking key roles in co-ordination. Northern Ireland has its own unique constitutional and organisational structures. Unlike in Great Britain, many services are delivered on a Northern Ireland-wide (regional) basis, either by government departments or by their agencies and NDPBs.  Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch website(http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm)The devolved administrations under the Civil Contingencies Act ScotlandPart 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act applies to Scotland, with the powers it sets out residing with Scottish Ministers in line with the devolution settlement. While civil protection in Scotland is largely a devolved matter and therefore the responsibility of the Scottish government, certain responders in Scotland are subject to Part 1 of the Act, the Regulations and guidance issued by UK ministers - the Health and Safety Executive, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the British Transport Police.WalesThe arrangements set out in Part 1 of the Act apply in Wales. However, there are some differences in the requirements which the Regulations place on Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales because of the unique administrative arrangements in Wales. As in England, the principal mechanism for co-operation between Category 1 and 2 responders under the Act will be the local resilience forums (LRFs). The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi-agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum is a non-statutory advisory body.
Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The duties of the Act apply only to a limited number of organisations which deliver functions that are not transferred. These organisations are: the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI); the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA); and telecommunications operators. Because these organisations do not represent the full spectrum of response agencies in Northern Ireland, the Regulations treat these organisations in a slightly different way. In practice, it is anticipated that the PSNI, MCA and telecommunications operators in Northern Ireland will undertake their duties under the Act, but will relate to the other public service bodies listed in the Regulations in line with the arrangements in the Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework and by participating in Northern Ireland co-operation, co-ordination and crisis management machinery.Further informationYou can find further details on all of the above in these documents: ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: devolution concordat with Scottish Ministers’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act-2004-devolution-  concordat-with-scottish-ministers) ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: concordat between the UK government and the Welsh government’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act- 2004-concordat-between-the-uk-g overnment-and-the-welsh-g overnment) ‘Emerg ency preparedness - chapter 10: Scotland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61033/Chap  ter-10-Scotland-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 11: Wales’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61034/Ch  apter-11-Wales-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 12: Northern Ireland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61035/Ch  apter-12-Northern-ireland-amends-10112011.pdf)Co-operation for emergency preparednessCo-operation between organisations is fundamental to emergency preparedness. A large number of organisations will need to co-operate when responding to emergencies, so it is right that organisations co-operate closely in preparedness and planning as well. The government aims to ensure all organisations co-operate in emergency preparedness, and robust co-operation arrangements are in place at every level. This section outlines who should co-operate, and how. It describes co- operation arrangements in place locally and points out the emphasis placed on co- operation within the Civil Contingencies Act.
Who should co-operate?Organisations will need to co-operate closely with any other organisation who would be involved in responding to and recovering from an emergency which affects that organisation.That will mean not just partner organisations, but contractors, and voluntary organisations who may be involved in the response. Organisations should consider their need to co-operate with a wide range of public (for example, local authorities, emergency services), commercial (for example, other businesses) and voluntary organisations (like charities and voluntary response organisations).What co-operation?Every-day co-operation between organisations is the lifeblood of civil protection work- through visits and seminars, phone calls and emails, and joint projects including exercises.Many organisations are well used to co-operating in both preparing for and responding to emergencies. The emergency services, for instance, obviously co- ordinate closely when responding to emergencies. They also co-operate closely in policy and planning, and undertake joint training and exercises. Likewise, utilities companies have close links with local authorities and the emergency services.Organisations should aim to co-operate bilaterally and attend multi-agency groups and forums to discuss co-ordinated and sometimes joint approaches to the essential aspects of emergency preparedness - risk assessment, emergency planning, business continuity management, and arrangements to warn and inform the public. Such forums should also consider producing multi-agency plans and other documents, including protocols and agreements, and the co-ordination of multi- agency exercises and other training events.Co-operation at the local level under the Civil Contingencies ActThe principle mechanism for multi-agency co-operation at the local level is the local resilience forum (LRF) (https://www.gov.uk/local-resilience-forums-contact-details). LRFs are generally based on local police areas, and bring together all the organisations who have a duty to co-operate under the Civil Contingencies Act, along with others who would be involved in the response.The purpose of the LRF process is to ensure effective delivery of those duties under the Act that need to be developed in a multi-agency environment.Co-operation at the sub-national level
Some co-operation and co-ordination takes place at multi-LRF level in England, which brings together representatives of local responders, and is supported by resilience advisers from DCLG-RED (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies), to work together to address larger-scale civil protection issues.Co-operation at the devolved administration levelSimilar co-operation and co-ordination arrangements are in place in the devolved administrations. For instance, in Scotland strategic co-ordinating groups are similar to LRFs, and the Scottish Emergencies Co-ordinating Committee (SECC) provides co-ordination and determines the national strategy for the development of civil protection. In Wales the Welsh Government (WG) provides that co-ordination, and a Wales Resilience Forum brings together local responders and UK government bodies. In Northern Ireland the Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is the forum for the development, discussion and agreement of Civil Protection Policy for the NI public services.Co-operation at the UK levelGovernment departments who are responsible for contingency planning and response within their own areas (for example, infectious diseases falls to Department of Health; fuel disruptions falls to Business Innovation and Skills), work closely together. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) in the Cabinet Office co- ordinates their work to enhance the country’s resilience to the full range of emergencies.Central government works very closely with the devolved administrations, local authorities and emergency services. Officials attend the full range of multi-agency forums and regularly go out to visit practitioners.Arrangements in EnglandThe Department for Communities and Local Government - Resilience and Emerg encies Division (DCLG-RED) (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies) provides the platform formulti-LRF co-operation and planning in emergency preparedness where this would add value by improving co-ordination between local and central response. This section outlines the arrangements in England for emergency preparedness at this level.Co-operation at the sub-national levelCo-operation at the sub-national level in England is a key element of the UK’s civil
protection framework. The sub-national tier is not a judgement on the local level; rather, it is a mechanism for improving co-ordination and communication into and out from the centre of government.Co-operation at the sub-national level involves the representatives of local responders and central government bodies working together to address larger-scale civil protection issues. Co-operation may take place within a multi-agency setting or directly between 2 or more responders.Role of the sub-national tierThe function of the sub-national tier is to improve co-ordination and communication between central government and local responders and other organisations and to ensure that areas are prepared to respond to events which would affect most or all of the area or which could overwhelm any locality. The successful delivery of the sub-national resilience capability rests critically on local responders and other organisations and central government working together in partnership to ensure effective and co-ordinated planning and response.Opportunities to collaborate and co-operate at a multi-LRF LevelPlanning for and responding to large-scale emergencies cannot be done in isolation in each local resilience forum (LRF). Mechanisms for cross-boundary working and relationship building are essential as some emergencies will overwhelm localities’ resources and/or boundaries.Collaboration and co-operation between localities in England is a well-established and critical way of working in civil contingencies. It is a mechanism:  for enabling pooling of resources to achieve agreed mutual aims and outcomes  for avoiding duplication of work between neighbouring LRFs or avoiding activity by an LRF that may be counter-productive to a neighbouring LRF to support planning and exercising for emergencies that cross local resilience areas or which could overwhelm a locality  that enables individual responders, local forums and central government to work together to address large-scale civil protection issuesDCLG-RED works directly with LRFs, supporting collaboration and co-operation in planning for wide-area high-impact events affecting more than one locality. RED has allocated Resilience Advisers to each LRF so that LRFs have named contacts with which to build working relationships. For more information, see chapter 16 of‘Emerg ency preparedness’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61039/Chapter-16-final-post-consultCCS_amends_16042012.pdf) on collaboration and co-operation between LRFs.

GuidancePreparation and planning for emergencies: responsibilities of responder agencies and othersHow the government prepares and plans for emergencies,working nationally, locally and co-operatively to ensure civil protection in the UK.From: Cabinet Office (/government/organisations/cabinet-office)Published 20 February 2013The Civil Contingencies ActThe Civil Contingencies Act (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents), and accompanying non-legislative measures, delivers a single framework for civil protection in the UK. The Act is separated into 2 substantive parts: local arrangements for civil protection (Part 1); and emergency powers (Part 2).Part 1Part 1 of the Act and supporting Regulations and statutory guidance ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency-preparedness) establish a clear set of roles and responsibilities for those involved in emergency preparation and response at the local level. The Act divides local responders into 2
categories, imposing a different set of duties on each.Those in Category 1 are organisations at the core of the response to most emergencies (the emergency services, local authorities, NHS bodies). Category 1 responders are subject to the full set of civil protection duties. They will be required to:  assess the risk of emergencies occurring and use this to inform contingency planning  put in place emergency plans  put in place business continuity management arrangements  put in place arrangements to make information available to the public about civil protection matters and maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public in the event of an emergency  share information with other local responders to enhance co-ordination  co-operate with other local responders to enhance co-ordination and efficiency  provide advice and assistance to businesses and voluntary organisations aboutbusiness continuity management (local authorities only)Category 2 organisations (the Health and Safety Executive, transport and utility companies) are ‘co-operating bodies’. They are less likely to be involved in the heart of planning work, but will be heavily involved in incidents that affect their own sector. Category 2 responders have a lesser set of duties - co-operating and sharing relevant information with other Category 1 and 2 responders.Category 1 and 2 organisations come together to form ‘local resilience forums’ (based on police areas) which will help co-ordination and co-operation between responders at the local level. For more on what LRFs do and contact details for each, see the guide on ‘Local resilience forums: contact details’ (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-resilience-forums-contact-details).The bulk of Part 1 of the Act was brought into force in November 2005 (the duty on local authorities to provide advice and assistance to business and voluntary organisations about business continuity management commenced in May 2006).Part 2Part 2 of the Act updates the 1920 Emergency Powers Act to reflect the developments in the intervening years and the current and future risk profile. It allows for the making of temporary special legislation (emergency regulations) to help deal with the most serious of emergencies. The use of emergency powers is a last resort option and planning arrangements at the local level should not assume that emergency powers will be made available. Their use is subject to a robust set of safeguards - they can only be deployed in exceptional circumstances.
Part 2 of the Act was brought into force in December 2004.

This section outlines what we mean by emergency planning, different types of plans, the importance of exercising them and training key staff, and the kind of factors which planners should consider.What is emergency planning?Emergency planning should aim where possible to prevent emergencies occurring, and when they do occur, good planning should reduce, control or mitigate the effects of the emergency. It is a systematic and ongoing process which should evolve as lessons are learnt and circumstances change.Emergency planning should be viewed as part of a cycle of activities beginning with establishing a risk profile to help determine what should be the priorities for developing plans and ending with review and revision, which then re-starts the
whole cycle. Plans should focus on at least 3 key groupings of people - the vulnerable, victims (including survivors, family and friends) and responder personnel.Vulnerable people may be less able to help themselves in an emergency than self- reliant people. Those who are vulnerable will vary depending on the nature of the emergency, but plans should consider: those with mobility difficulties (those with physical disabilities or pregnant women); those with mental health difficulties; and others who are dependent, such as children.Victims of an emergency - which includes not only those directly affected but also those who, as family and friends, suffer bereavement or the anxiety of not knowing what has happened.Responder personnel should also be considered. Plans sometimes place unrealistic expectations on management and personnel. Organisations should ensure their plans give due consideration to the welfare of their own personnel. For instance, the emergency services have health and safety procedures which determine shift patterns and check for levels of stress.Organisations should aim to maintain plans which cover 3 different areas:Plans for preventing an emergencyIn some circumstances there will be a short period before an emergency occurs when it might be avoided by prompt or decisive actionPlans for reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency The main bulk of planning should consider how to minimise the effects of an emergency, starting with the impact of the event (ie their alerting procedures) and looking at remedial actions that can be taken to reduce effects. For example, theemergency services may be able to stem the emergency at source by fighting fires, combating the release of toxic chemicals or the extent of floods. The evacuation of people may be a direct intervention which can mitigate the effects of some emergencies. Recovery plans should also be developed to reduce the effects of the emergency and ensure long term recovery. The National Recovery Guidance (http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/national-recovery-g uidance) provides more detail on recovery issues.Plans for taking other action in connection with an emergencyNot all actions to be taken in preparing for an emergency are directly concerned with controlling, reducing or mitigating its effects. Emergency planning should look beyond the immediate response and long term recovery issues and look also at secondary impacts. For example, the wave of reaction to an emergency can be quite overwhelming in terms of media attention and public response. Plans may need to consider how to handle this increased interest.As obvious as it sounds, emergency plans should include procedures for determining whether an emergency has occurred, and when to activate the plan in
response to an emergency. This should include identifying an appropriately trained person who will take the decision, in consultation with others, on when an emergency has occurred.The maintenance of plans involves more than just their preparation. Once a plan has been prepared, it must be maintained systematically to ensure it remains up-to-date and fit for purpose at any time if an emergency occurs.It may be that multiple organisations can develop a joint emergency plan where the partners agree that, for a successful combined response, they need a formal set of procedures governing them all. For example, in the event that evacuation is required, the police would need carefully pre-planned co-operation from various other organisations such as fire and ambulance services and the local authority, as well as involvement of others such as transport organisations.Types of emergency plansIt may be important for an organisation to have more than one emergency plan. It is often the case that organisations have generic plans and more specific plans.Generic plans are the core plan which enables the organisation to respond to, and recover from a wide range of possible emergencies. They should include procedures which would be used in all instances for ensuring the welfare of staff and the provision of sufficient resources for responding to the emergency.Specific plans relate either to a particular emergency or kind of emergency, or to a specific site or location. Specific plans are a detailed set of arrangements designed to go beyond the generic arrangements when they are likely to prove insufficient in a particular case. A specific plan usually builds on a generic plan. For example, organisations which deal with hazardous materials may need specific plans for responding to a chemical spillage. Some organisations may have specific plans for conducting specific functions in response to an emergency. For instance, the emergency services will have plans for mass evacuation of an urban area and mass decontamination. Organisations should use their risk assessments to decide whether specific plans are necessary or desirable.Exercising plans and training staffOrganisations should test the effectiveness of their emergency plans by carrying out exercises, and should ensure that staff involved in the planning for or response to an emergency receive appropriate training. Training plans should also consider other people who have a role in the emergency plans such as contractors and civil protection partners. The plans themselves should explicitly identify the nature and frequency of training and exercising required. The guide Emerg ency planning and preparedness: exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and- preparedness-exercises-and-training) provides more information.
Emergency planning at the local levelEmergency planning is at the heart of the civil protection duty on Category 1 responders under the Civil Contingencies Act. The Act requires Category 1 responders to maintain plans for preventing emergencies; reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of emergencies; and taking other action in the event of emergencies. These should draw on risk assessments and should have regard for the arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public at the time of an emerg ency (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme#warning-and-informing-the-public).The Regulations require plans to contain a procedure for determining whether an emergency has occurred; provision for training key staff; and provision for exercising the plan to ensure it is effective. Procedures should also be put in place to ensure that the plan is reviewed periodically and kept up to date.Category 1 responders should involve Category 2 responders - and other organisations which are not subject to the Act’s requirements - as appropriate throughout the planning process. Category 1 responders are specifically required to have regard to the activities of relevant voluntary organisations when developing plans. The Regulations permit Category 1 responders to collaborate with other organisations in delivering the emergency planning duty.Category 1 responders also have a statutory duty to publish their emergency plans, to the extent necessary or desirable for the purpose of dealing with an emergency.Emergency planning at the sub-national levelPlanning at a multi-LRF level is different from planning at the local level. For more information on the sub-national tier, see the Arrangements in England (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-responsibilities-of-responder- agencies-and-others#arrangements-in-england) section.Emergency planning in the devolved administrationsIt is equally important that organisations within the devolved administrations conduct effective emergency planning. The devolved administrations section below provides more detail on the extent to which the Civil Contingencies Act duties apply and their individual emergency planning arrangements.The government works closely with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to promote effective emergency planning that is, as far as possible, consistent with that of the rest of the UK.Emergency planning at the UK government level
The UK government capabilities programme is the core framework through which the government is seeking to build resilience across all parts of the UK. The programme uses risk assessment over a 5-year period to identify the generic capabilities that underpin the UK’s resilience to disruptive challenges, and ensures that each of these is developed. These capabilities include dealing with mass casualties and fatalities, response to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear incidents, provision of essential services and warning and informing the public. A full list of the current capabilities can be found in this g uide to the capabilities programme (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme).The government has in place a coordinated cross-governmental exercise programme covering a comprehensive range of domestic disruptive challenges, including accidents, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. The programme is designed to test rigorously the concept of operations from the coordinated central response through the range of lead government department responsibilities and the involvement of the devolved administrations, to the sub-national tier and local responders. More information is provided in the g uide to emerg ency exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and-preparedness-exercises-and-training).These national processes feed into the devolved administrations, sub-national and local levels to ensure fully integrated emergency planning at all levels throughout the UK.The role of the voluntary sector in emergency planning and responseWhere appropriate, organisations should consider at an early stage in planning whether voluntary organisations may have capabilities which could assist in responding to an emergency.The voluntary sector can provide a wide range of skills and services in responding to an emergency. These include: practical support (such as first aid, transportation, or provisions for responders); psycho-social support (such as counselling and helplines); equipment (radios, medical equipment); and information services (such as public training and communications).Existing emergency planning dutiesThe Civil Contingencies Act Regulations identify 3 pieces of legislation pre-dating this Act which were introduced separately in Britain and Northern Ireland under sector-specific legislation operated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and HSE Northern Ireland. These relate to major accident hazards at industrial establishments (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (COMAH)), to hazardous pipelines (Pipelines Safety Regulations) and to radiation hazards (Radiation (Emergency Preparation and Public Information) Regulations (REPPIR)). These sector-specific Regulations have established multi-agency emergency planning regimes in co-operation with the operators. To avoid duplication, the Civil
Contingencies Act Regulations provide that the duty to maintain plans under the Act does not apply to emergencies which are dealt with by these pieces of legislation.For more information on how the Act fits with other legislation see chapter 19 of ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Important documentsEmerg ency Preparedness (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness)  Chapter 5: “Emergency planning”  Annex 5a: “Examples of generic and specific plans”  Annex 5B: “Generic plan: emergency or major incident”  Annex 5C: “Specific plan”  Annex 5D: “Example of a plan maintenance matrix for a local authority”Chapter 7 “Communicating with the public” - Contains further detail on communicating with the vulnerable and victims in an emergency  Annex 7A: “Communicating with the public: the national context “  Annex 7B: “Lead responsibility for warning and informing the public”  Annex 7C: “Checklist of suggested protocols”Chapter 14: “The role of the voluntary sector” Annex 14A: “Examples of voluntary sector activities in support of statutory services”  Home Office document Recovery: an emerg ency management guide(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recovery-an-emerg ency-management-g uide)  Communicating risk guidance(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/communicating-risk-g uidance) Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm) - a guide to emergency planning arrangements, risk assessment and other documentation is available on this website London’s strategic emerg ency plan (http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/london- prepared/home)Devolved administrationsThis section describes emergency preparedness and planning arrangements in the devolved administrations, where these differ from UK government and local
arrangements in England. It also outlines how Part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act and its associated Regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. More detail on the specific duties under the Act and how they apply in the Devolved Administrations can be found in chapters 2 to 8 of the guidance document‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Emergency preparedness in ScotlandIn devolved areas the Scottish government is designated as the lead on relevant issues in line with the ‘lead department’ principle at the UK level. In reserved areas the Scottish government works closely with the UK government to ensure that Scottish needs are catered for.Overall responsibility for civil protection policy in Scotland sits with the Scottish Resilience Division of the Scottish government.At the local level in Scotland, 8 strategic coordinating groups based on current police force areas promote effective planning for all types of incidents in their area, involving risk assessment, making generic and specific emergency plans, engaging with the community, training, testing, exercising and reviewing.  Scottish government civil emerg encies website(http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/public-safety/emerg encies)Emergency preparedness in WalesThe Welsh government (WG) or Wales Office, depending on the subject matter, is represented on relevant committees and forums within the UK government relating to civil protection. They work closely with UK government departments to ensure that UK civil protection policy and planning is tailored to Welsh needs. A dedicated team in WG supports multi-agency co-operation in Wales and engagement with the UK government on issues relating to civil protection and emergency preparedness.As in England, local resilience forums (LRFs) are the principle mechanism for multi- agency co-operation on civil protection issues. The respective Chief Constables presently chair the LRFs in the South Wales, North Wales, Dyfed-Powys and Gwent areas. The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi- agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum meets quarterly and is chaired by the First Minister or the Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration. Risk assessment at a pan-Wales level is undertaken by the Wales Risk Assessment Group (WRAG) reporting to the WRF.A number of other groups provide forums for discussion and co-ordination of civil protection in Wales, including: the Joint Emergency Services Group; the Wales Media Emergency Forum; and the Welsh Borders Resilience Group.
  Welsh civil emerg encies website (https://gov.wales/wales-resilience-forum)Emergency preparedness in Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) in the UK government is, however, responsible for, amongst other things, policing, criminal justice and security in Northern Ireland.The Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (CCPB) in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) promotes and co-ordinates civil protection arrangements in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland government would normally have oversight of civil contingencies arrangements for transferred functions. The ‘lead government department’ principle applies to Northern Ireland departments as at the UK level.The Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is a pan-Northern Ireland multi-agency forum for the development, discussion and agreement of civil protection policy. Co-ordination at local and sub-regional levels may be facilitated by a range of organisations, with police district commanders and district council chief executives taking key roles in co-ordination. Northern Ireland has its own unique constitutional and organisational structures. Unlike in Great Britain, many services are delivered on a Northern Ireland-wide (regional) basis, either by government departments or by their agencies and NDPBs.  Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch website(http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm)The devolved administrations under the Civil Contingencies Act ScotlandPart 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act applies to Scotland, with the powers it sets out residing with Scottish Ministers in line with the devolution settlement. While civil protection in Scotland is largely a devolved matter and therefore the responsibility of the Scottish government, certain responders in Scotland are subject to Part 1 of the Act, the Regulations and guidance issued by UK ministers - the Health and Safety Executive, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the British Transport Police.WalesThe arrangements set out in Part 1 of the Act apply in Wales. However, there are some differences in the requirements which the Regulations place on Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales because of the unique administrative arrangements in Wales. As in England, the principal mechanism for co-operation between Category 1 and 2 responders under the Act will be the local resilience forums (LRFs). The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi-agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum is a non-statutory advisory body.
Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The duties of the Act apply only to a limited number of organisations which deliver functions that are not transferred. These organisations are: the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI); the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA); and telecommunications operators. Because these organisations do not represent the full spectrum of response agencies in Northern Ireland, the Regulations treat these organisations in a slightly different way. In practice, it is anticipated that the PSNI, MCA and telecommunications operators in Northern Ireland will undertake their duties under the Act, but will relate to the other public service bodies listed in the Regulations in line with the arrangements in the Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework and by participating in Northern Ireland co-operation, co-ordination and crisis management machinery.Further informationYou can find further details on all of the above in these documents: ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: devolution concordat with Scottish Ministers’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act-2004-devolution-  concordat-with-scottish-ministers) ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: concordat between the UK government and the Welsh government’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act- 2004-concordat-between-the-uk-g overnment-and-the-welsh-g overnment) ‘Emerg ency preparedness - chapter 10: Scotland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61033/Chap  ter-10-Scotland-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 11: Wales’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61034/Ch  apter-11-Wales-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 12: Northern Ireland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61035/Ch  apter-12-Northern-ireland-amends-10112011.pdf)Co-operation for emergency preparednessCo-operation between organisations is fundamental to emergency preparedness. A large number of organisations will need to co-operate when responding to emergencies, so it is right that organisations co-operate closely in preparedness and planning as well. The government aims to ensure all organisations co-operate in emergency preparedness, and robust co-operation arrangements are in place at every level. This section outlines who should co-operate, and how. It describes co- operation arrangements in place locally and points out the emphasis placed on co- operation within the Civil Contingencies Act.
Who should co-operate?Organisations will need to co-operate closely with any other organisation who would be involved in responding to and recovering from an emergency which affects that organisation.That will mean not just partner organisations, but contractors, and voluntary organisations who may be involved in the response. Organisations should consider their need to co-operate with a wide range of public (for example, local authorities, emergency services), commercial (for example, other businesses) and voluntary organisations (like charities and voluntary response organisations).What co-operation?Every-day co-operation between organisations is the lifeblood of civil protection work- through visits and seminars, phone calls and emails, and joint projects including exercises.Many organisations are well used to co-operating in both preparing for and responding to emergencies. The emergency services, for instance, obviously co- ordinate closely when responding to emergencies. They also co-operate closely in policy and planning, and undertake joint training and exercises. Likewise, utilities companies have close links with local authorities and the emergency services.Organisations should aim to co-operate bilaterally and attend multi-agency groups and forums to discuss co-ordinated and sometimes joint approaches to the essential aspects of emergency preparedness - risk assessment, emergency planning, business continuity management, and arrangements to warn and inform the public. Such forums should also consider producing multi-agency plans and other documents, including protocols and agreements, and the co-ordination of multi- agency exercises and other training events.Co-operation at the local level under the Civil Contingencies ActThe principle mechanism for multi-agency co-operation at the local level is the local resilience forum (LRF) (https://www.gov.uk/local-resilience-forums-contact-details). LRFs are generally based on local police areas, and bring together all the organisations who have a duty to co-operate under the Civil Contingencies Act, along with others who would be involved in the response.The purpose of the LRF process is to ensure effective delivery of those duties under the Act that need to be developed in a multi-agency environment.Co-operation at the sub-national level
Some co-operation and co-ordination takes place at multi-LRF level in England, which brings together representatives of local responders, and is supported by resilience advisers from DCLG-RED (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies), to work together to address larger-scale civil protection issues.Co-operation at the devolved administration levelSimilar co-operation and co-ordination arrangements are in place in the devolved administrations. For instance, in Scotland strategic co-ordinating groups are similar to LRFs, and the Scottish Emergencies Co-ordinating Committee (SECC) provides co-ordination and determines the national strategy for the development of civil protection. In Wales the Welsh Government (WG) provides that co-ordination, and a Wales Resilience Forum brings together local responders and UK government bodies. In Northern Ireland the Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is the forum for the development, discussion and agreement of Civil Protection Policy for the NI public services.Co-operation at the UK levelGovernment departments who are responsible for contingency planning and response within their own areas (for example, infectious diseases falls to Department of Health; fuel disruptions falls to Business Innovation and Skills), work closely together. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) in the Cabinet Office co- ordinates their work to enhance the country’s resilience to the full range of emergencies.Central government works very closely with the devolved administrations, local authorities and emergency services. Officials attend the full range of multi-agency forums and regularly go out to visit practitioners.Arrangements in EnglandThe Department for Communities and Local Government - Resilience and Emerg encies Division (DCLG-RED) (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies) provides the platform formulti-LRF co-operation and planning in emergency preparedness where this would add value by improving co-ordination between local and central response. This section outlines the arrangements in England for emergency preparedness at this level.Co-operation at the sub-national levelCo-operation at the sub-national level in England is a key element of the UK’s civil
protection framework. The sub-national tier is not a judgement on the local level; rather, it is a mechanism for improving co-ordination and communication into and out from the centre of government.Co-operation at the sub-national level involves the representatives of local responders and central government bodies working together to address larger-scale civil protection issues. Co-operation may take place within a multi-agency setting or directly between 2 or more responders.Role of the sub-national tierThe function of the sub-national tier is to improve co-ordination and communication between central government and local responders and other organisations and to ensure that areas are prepared to respond to events which would affect most or all of the area or which could overwhelm any locality. The successful delivery of the sub-national resilience capability rests critically on local responders and other organisations and central government working together in partnership to ensure effective and co-ordinated planning and response.Opportunities to collaborate and co-operate at a multi-LRF LevelPlanning for and responding to large-scale emergencies cannot be done in isolation in each local resilience forum (LRF). Mechanisms for cross-boundary working and relationship building are essential as some emergencies will overwhelm localities’ resources and/or boundaries.Collaboration and co-operation between localities in England is a well-established and critical way of working in civil contingencies. It is a mechanism:  for enabling pooling of resources to achieve agreed mutual aims and outcomes  for avoiding duplication of work between neighbouring LRFs or avoiding activity by an LRF that may be counter-productive to a neighbouring LRF to support planning and exercising for emergencies that cross local resilience areas or which could overwhelm a locality  that enables individual responders, local forums and central government to work together to address large-scale civil protection issuesDCLG-RED works directly with LRFs, supporting collaboration and co-operation in planning for wide-area high-impact events affecting more than one locality. RED has allocated Resilience Advisers to each LRF so that LRFs have named contacts with which to build working relationships. For more information, see chapter 16 of‘Emerg ency preparedness’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61039/Chapter-16-final-post-consultCCS_amends_16042012.pdf) on collaboration and co-operation between LRFs.

GuidancePreparation and planning for emergencies: responsibilities of responder agencies and othersHow the government prepares and plans for emergencies,working nationally, locally and co-operatively to ensure civil protection in the UK.From: Cabinet Office (/government/organisations/cabinet-office)Published 20 February 2013The Civil Contingencies ActThe Civil Contingencies Act (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents), and accompanying non-legislative measures, delivers a single framework for civil protection in the UK. The Act is separated into 2 substantive parts: local arrangements for civil protection (Part 1); and emergency powers (Part 2).Part 1Part 1 of the Act and supporting Regulations and statutory guidance ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency-preparedness) establish a clear set of roles and responsibilities for those involved in emergency preparation and response at the local level. The Act divides local responders into 2
categories, imposing a different set of duties on each.Those in Category 1 are organisations at the core of the response to most emergencies (the emergency services, local authorities, NHS bodies). Category 1 responders are subject to the full set of civil protection duties. They will be required to:  assess the risk of emergencies occurring and use this to inform contingency planning  put in place emergency plans  put in place business continuity management arrangements  put in place arrangements to make information available to the public about civil protection matters and maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public in the event of an emergency  share information with other local responders to enhance co-ordination  co-operate with other local responders to enhance co-ordination and efficiency  provide advice and assistance to businesses and voluntary organisations aboutbusiness continuity management (local authorities only)Category 2 organisations (the Health and Safety Executive, transport and utility companies) are ‘co-operating bodies’. They are less likely to be involved in the heart of planning work, but will be heavily involved in incidents that affect their own sector. Category 2 responders have a lesser set of duties - co-operating and sharing relevant information with other Category 1 and 2 responders.Category 1 and 2 organisations come together to form ‘local resilience forums’ (based on police areas) which will help co-ordination and co-operation between responders at the local level. For more on what LRFs do and contact details for each, see the guide on ‘Local resilience forums: contact details’ (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-resilience-forums-contact-details).The bulk of Part 1 of the Act was brought into force in November 2005 (the duty on local authorities to provide advice and assistance to business and voluntary organisations about business continuity management commenced in May 2006).Part 2Part 2 of the Act updates the 1920 Emergency Powers Act to reflect the developments in the intervening years and the current and future risk profile. It allows for the making of temporary special legislation (emergency regulations) to help deal with the most serious of emergencies. The use of emergency powers is a last resort option and planning arrangements at the local level should not assume that emergency powers will be made available. Their use is subject to a robust set of safeguards - they can only be deployed in exceptional circumstances.
Part 2 of the Act was brought into force in December 2004.

This section outlines what we mean by emergency planning, different types of plans, the importance of exercising them and training key staff, and the kind of factors which planners should consider.What is emergency planning?Emergency planning should aim where possible to prevent emergencies occurring, and when they do occur, good planning should reduce, control or mitigate the effects of the emergency. It is a systematic and ongoing process which should evolve as lessons are learnt and circumstances change.Emergency planning should be viewed as part of a cycle of activities beginning with establishing a risk profile to help determine what should be the priorities for developing plans and ending with review and revision, which then re-starts the
whole cycle. Plans should focus on at least 3 key groupings of people - the vulnerable, victims (including survivors, family and friends) and responder personnel.Vulnerable people may be less able to help themselves in an emergency than self- reliant people. Those who are vulnerable will vary depending on the nature of the emergency, but plans should consider: those with mobility difficulties (those with physical disabilities or pregnant women); those with mental health difficulties; and others who are dependent, such as children.Victims of an emergency - which includes not only those directly affected but also those who, as family and friends, suffer bereavement or the anxiety of not knowing what has happened.Responder personnel should also be considered. Plans sometimes place unrealistic expectations on management and personnel. Organisations should ensure their plans give due consideration to the welfare of their own personnel. For instance, the emergency services have health and safety procedures which determine shift patterns and check for levels of stress.Organisations should aim to maintain plans which cover 3 different areas:Plans for preventing an emergencyIn some circumstances there will be a short period before an emergency occurs when it might be avoided by prompt or decisive actionPlans for reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency The main bulk of planning should consider how to minimise the effects of an emergency, starting with the impact of the event (ie their alerting procedures) and looking at remedial actions that can be taken to reduce effects. For example, theemergency services may be able to stem the emergency at source by fighting fires, combating the release of toxic chemicals or the extent of floods. The evacuation of people may be a direct intervention which can mitigate the effects of some emergencies. Recovery plans should also be developed to reduce the effects of the emergency and ensure long term recovery. The National Recovery Guidance (http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/national-recovery-g uidance) provides more detail on recovery issues.Plans for taking other action in connection with an emergencyNot all actions to be taken in preparing for an emergency are directly concerned with controlling, reducing or mitigating its effects. Emergency planning should look beyond the immediate response and long term recovery issues and look also at secondary impacts. For example, the wave of reaction to an emergency can be quite overwhelming in terms of media attention and public response. Plans may need to consider how to handle this increased interest.As obvious as it sounds, emergency plans should include procedures for determining whether an emergency has occurred, and when to activate the plan in
response to an emergency. This should include identifying an appropriately trained person who will take the decision, in consultation with others, on when an emergency has occurred.The maintenance of plans involves more than just their preparation. Once a plan has been prepared, it must be maintained systematically to ensure it remains up-to-date and fit for purpose at any time if an emergency occurs.It may be that multiple organisations can develop a joint emergency plan where the partners agree that, for a successful combined response, they need a formal set of procedures governing them all. For example, in the event that evacuation is required, the police would need carefully pre-planned co-operation from various other organisations such as fire and ambulance services and the local authority, as well as involvement of others such as transport organisations.Types of emergency plansIt may be important for an organisation to have more than one emergency plan. It is often the case that organisations have generic plans and more specific plans.Generic plans are the core plan which enables the organisation to respond to, and recover from a wide range of possible emergencies. They should include procedures which would be used in all instances for ensuring the welfare of staff and the provision of sufficient resources for responding to the emergency.Specific plans relate either to a particular emergency or kind of emergency, or to a specific site or location. Specific plans are a detailed set of arrangements designed to go beyond the generic arrangements when they are likely to prove insufficient in a particular case. A specific plan usually builds on a generic plan. For example, organisations which deal with hazardous materials may need specific plans for responding to a chemical spillage. Some organisations may have specific plans for conducting specific functions in response to an emergency. For instance, the emergency services will have plans for mass evacuation of an urban area and mass decontamination. Organisations should use their risk assessments to decide whether specific plans are necessary or desirable.Exercising plans and training staffOrganisations should test the effectiveness of their emergency plans by carrying out exercises, and should ensure that staff involved in the planning for or response to an emergency receive appropriate training. Training plans should also consider other people who have a role in the emergency plans such as contractors and civil protection partners. The plans themselves should explicitly identify the nature and frequency of training and exercising required. The guide Emerg ency planning and preparedness: exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and- preparedness-exercises-and-training) provides more information.
Emergency planning at the local levelEmergency planning is at the heart of the civil protection duty on Category 1 responders under the Civil Contingencies Act. The Act requires Category 1 responders to maintain plans for preventing emergencies; reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of emergencies; and taking other action in the event of emergencies. These should draw on risk assessments and should have regard for the arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public at the time of an emerg ency (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme#warning-and-informing-the-public).The Regulations require plans to contain a procedure for determining whether an emergency has occurred; provision for training key staff; and provision for exercising the plan to ensure it is effective. Procedures should also be put in place to ensure that the plan is reviewed periodically and kept up to date.Category 1 responders should involve Category 2 responders - and other organisations which are not subject to the Act’s requirements - as appropriate throughout the planning process. Category 1 responders are specifically required to have regard to the activities of relevant voluntary organisations when developing plans. The Regulations permit Category 1 responders to collaborate with other organisations in delivering the emergency planning duty.Category 1 responders also have a statutory duty to publish their emergency plans, to the extent necessary or desirable for the purpose of dealing with an emergency.Emergency planning at the sub-national levelPlanning at a multi-LRF level is different from planning at the local level.

The devolved administrations section below provides more detail on the extent to which the Civil Contingencies Act duties apply and their individual emergency planning arrangements.The government works closely with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to promote effective emergency planning that is, as far as possible, consistent with that of the rest of the UK.Emergency planning at the UK government level
The UK government capabilities programme is the core framework through which the government is seeking to build resilience across all parts of the UK. The programme uses risk assessment over a 5-year period to identify the generic capabilities that underpin the UK’s resilience to disruptive challenges, and ensures that each of these is developed. These capabilities include dealing with mass casualties and fatalities, response to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear incidents, provision of essential services and warning and informing the public. A full list of the current capabilities can be found in this g uide to the capabilities programme (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme).The government has in place a coordinated cross-governmental exercise programme covering a comprehensive range of domestic disruptive challenges, including accidents, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. The programme is designed to test rigorously the concept of operations from the coordinated central response through the range of lead government department responsibilities and the involvement of the devolved administrations, to the sub-national tier and local responders. More information is provided in the g uide to emerg ency exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and-preparedness-exercises-and-training).These national processes feed into the devolved administrations, sub-national and local levels to ensure fully integrated emergency planning at all levels throughout the UK.The role of the voluntary sector in emergency planning and responseWhere appropriate, organisations should consider at an early stage in planning whether voluntary organisations may have capabilities which could assist in responding to an emergency.The voluntary sector can provide a wide range of skills and services in responding to an emergency. These include: practical support (such as first aid, transportation, or provisions for responders); psycho-social support (such as counselling and helplines); equipment (radios, medical equipment); and information services (such as public training and communications).Existing emergency planning dutiesThe Civil Contingencies Act Regulations identify 3 pieces of legislation pre-dating this Act which were introduced separately in Britain and Northern Ireland under sector-specific legislation operated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and HSE Northern Ireland. These relate to major accident hazards at industrial establishments (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (COMAH)), to hazardous pipelines (Pipelines Safety Regulations) and to radiation hazards (Radiation (Emergency Preparation and Public Information) Regulations (REPPIR)). These sector-specific Regulations have established multi-agency emergency planning regimes in co-operation with the operators. To avoid duplication, the Civil
Contingencies Act Regulations provide that the duty to maintain plans under the Act does not apply to emergencies which are dealt with by these pieces of legislation.For more information on how the Act fits with other legislation see chapter 19 of ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Important documentsEmerg ency Preparedness (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness)  Chapter 5: “Emergency planning”  Annex 5a: “Examples of generic and specific plans”  Annex 5B: “Generic plan: emergency or major incident”  Annex 5C: “Specific plan”  Annex 5D: “Example of a plan maintenance matrix for a local authority”Chapter 7 “Communicating with the public” - Contains further detail on communicating with the vulnerable and victims in an emergency  Annex 7A: “Communicating with the public: the national context “  Annex 7B: “Lead responsibility for warning and informing the public”  Annex 7C: “Checklist of suggested protocols”Chapter 14: “The role of the voluntary sector” Annex 14A: “Examples of voluntary sector activities in support of statutory services”  Home Office document Recovery: an emerg ency management guide(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recovery-an-emerg ency-management-g uide)  Communicating risk guidance(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/communicating-risk-g uidance) Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm) - a guide to emergency planning arrangements, risk assessment and other documentation is available on this website London’s strategic emerg ency plan (http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/london- prepared/home)Devolved administrationsThis section describes emergency preparedness and planning arrangements in the devolved administrations, where these differ from UK government and local
arrangements in England. It also outlines how Part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act and its associated Regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. More detail on the specific duties under the Act and how they apply in the Devolved Administrations can be found in chapters 2 to 8 of the guidance document‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Emergency preparedness in ScotlandIn devolved areas the Scottish government is designated as the lead on relevant issues in line with the ‘lead department’ principle at the UK level. In reserved areas the Scottish government works closely with the UK government to ensure that Scottish needs are catered for.Overall responsibility for civil protection policy in Scotland sits with the Scottish Resilience Division of the Scottish government.At the local level in Scotland, 8 strategic coordinating groups based on current police force areas promote effective planning for all types of incidents in their area, involving risk assessment, making generic and specific emergency plans, engaging with the community, training, testing, exercising and reviewing.  Scottish government civil emerg encies website(http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/public-safety/emerg encies)Emergency preparedness in WalesThe Welsh government (WG) or Wales Office, depending on the subject matter, is represented on relevant committees and forums within the UK government relating to civil protection. They work closely with UK government departments to ensure that UK civil protection policy and planning is tailored to Welsh needs. A dedicated team in WG supports multi-agency co-operation in Wales and engagement with the UK government on issues relating to civil protection and emergency preparedness.As in England, local resilience forums (LRFs) are the principle mechanism for multi- agency co-operation on civil protection issues. The respective Chief Constables presently chair the LRFs in the South Wales, North Wales, Dyfed-Powys and Gwent areas. The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi- agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum meets quarterly and is chaired by the First Minister or the Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration. Risk assessment at a pan-Wales level is undertaken by the Wales Risk Assessment Group (WRAG) reporting to the WRF.A number of other groups provide forums for discussion and co-ordination of civil protection in Wales, including: the Joint Emergency Services Group; the Wales Media Emergency Forum; and the Welsh Borders Resilience Group.
  Welsh civil emerg encies website (https://gov.wales/wales-resilience-forum)Emergency preparedness in Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) in the UK government is, however, responsible for, amongst other things, policing, criminal justice and security in Northern Ireland.The Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (CCPB) in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) promotes and co-ordinates civil protection arrangements in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland government would normally have oversight of civil contingencies arrangements for transferred functions. The ‘lead government department’ principle applies to Northern Ireland departments as at the UK level.The Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is a pan-Northern Ireland multi-agency forum for the development, discussion and agreement of civil protection policy. Co-ordination at local and sub-regional levels may be facilitated by a range of organisations, with police district commanders and district council chief executives taking key roles in co-ordination. Northern Ireland has its own unique constitutional and organisational structures. Unlike in Great Britain, many services are delivered on a Northern Ireland-wide (regional) basis, either by government departments or by their agencies and NDPBs.  Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch website(http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm)The devolved administrations under the Civil Contingencies Act ScotlandPart 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act applies to Scotland, with the powers it sets out residing with Scottish Ministers in line with the devolution settlement. While civil protection in Scotland is largely a devolved matter and therefore the responsibility of the Scottish government, certain responders in Scotland are subject to Part 1 of the Act, the Regulations and guidance issued by UK ministers - the Health and Safety Executive, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the British Transport Police.WalesThe arrangements set out in Part 1 of the Act apply in Wales. However, there are some differences in the requirements which the Regulations place on Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales because of the unique administrative arrangements in Wales. As in England, the principal mechanism for co-operation between Category 1 and 2 responders under the Act will be the local resilience forums (LRFs). The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi-agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum is a non-statutory advisory body.
Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The duties of the Act apply only to a limited number of organisations which deliver functions that are not transferred. These organisations are: the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI); the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA); and telecommunications operators. Because these organisations do not represent the full spectrum of response agencies in Northern Ireland, the Regulations treat these organisations in a slightly different way. In practice, it is anticipated that the PSNI, MCA and telecommunications operators in Northern Ireland will undertake their duties under the Act, but will relate to the other public service bodies listed in the Regulations in line with the arrangements in the Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework and by participating in Northern Ireland co-operation, co-ordination and crisis management machinery.Further informationYou can find further details on all of the above in these documents: ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: devolution concordat with Scottish Ministers’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act-2004-devolution-  concordat-with-scottish-ministers) ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: concordat between the UK government and the Welsh government’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act- 2004-concordat-between-the-uk-g overnment-and-the-welsh-g overnment) ‘Emerg ency preparedness - chapter 10: Scotland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61033/Chap  ter-10-Scotland-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 11: Wales’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61034/Ch  apter-11-Wales-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 12: Northern Ireland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61035/Ch  apter-12-Northern-ireland-amends-10112011.pdf)Co-operation for emergency preparednessCo-operation between organisations is fundamental to emergency preparedness. A large number of organisations will need to co-operate when responding to emergencies, so it is right that organisations co-operate closely in preparedness and planning as well. The government aims to ensure all organisations co-operate in emergency preparedness, and robust co-operation arrangements are in place at every level. This section outlines who should co-operate, and how. It describes co- operation arrangements in place locally and points out the emphasis placed on co- operation within the Civil Contingencies Act.
Who should co-operate?Organisations will need to co-operate closely with any other organisation who would be involved in responding to and recovering from an emergency which affects that organisation.That will mean not just partner organisations, but contractors, and voluntary organisations who may be involved in the response. Organisations should consider their need to co-operate with a wide range of public (for example, local authorities, emergency services), commercial (for example, other businesses) and voluntary organisations (like charities and voluntary response organisations).What co-operation?Every-day co-operation between organisations is the lifeblood of civil protection work- through visits and seminars, phone calls and emails, and joint projects including exercises.Many organisations are well used to co-operating in both preparing for and responding to emergencies. The emergency services, for instance, obviously co- ordinate closely when responding to emergencies. They also co-operate closely in policy and planning, and undertake joint training and exercises. Likewise, utilities companies have close links with local authorities and the emergency services.Organisations should aim to co-operate bilaterally and attend multi-agency groups and forums to discuss co-ordinated and sometimes joint approaches to the essential aspects of emergency preparedness - risk assessment, emergency planning, business continuity management, and arrangements to warn and inform the public. Such forums should also consider producing multi-agency plans and other documents, including protocols and agreements, and the co-ordination of multi- agency exercises and other training events.Co-operation at the local level under the Civil Contingencies ActThe principle mechanism for multi-agency co-operation at the local level is the local resilience forum (LRF) (https://www.gov.uk/local-resilience-forums-contact-details). LRFs are generally based on local police areas, and bring together all the organisations who have a duty to co-operate under the Civil Contingencies Act, along with others who would be involved in the response.The purpose of the LRF process is to ensure effective delivery of those duties under the Act that need to be developed in a multi-agency environment.Co-operation at the sub-national level
Some co-operation and co-ordination takes place at multi-LRF level in England, which brings together representatives of local responders, and is supported by resilience advisers from DCLG-RED (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies), to work together to address larger-scale civil protection issues.Co-operation at the devolved administration levelSimilar co-operation and co-ordination arrangements are in place in the devolved administrations. For instance, in Scotland strategic co-ordinating groups are similar to LRFs, and the Scottish Emergencies Co-ordinating Committee (SECC) provides co-ordination and determines the national strategy for the development of civil protection. In Wales the Welsh Government (WG) provides that co-ordination, and a Wales Resilience Forum brings together local responders and UK government bodies. In Northern Ireland the Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is the forum for the development, discussion and agreement of Civil Protection Policy for the NI public services.Co-operation at the UK levelGovernment departments who are responsible for contingency planning and response within their own areas (for example, infectious diseases falls to Department of Health; fuel disruptions falls to Business Innovation and Skills), work closely together. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) in the Cabinet Office co- ordinates their work to enhance the country’s resilience to the full range of emergencies.Central government works very closely with the devolved administrations, local authorities and emergency services. Officials attend the full range of multi-agency forums and regularly go out to visit practitioners.Arrangements in EnglandThe Department for Communities and Local Government - Resilience and Emerg encies Division (DCLG-RED) (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies) provides the platform formulti-LRF co-operation and planning in emergency preparedness where this would add value by improving co-ordination between local and central response. This section outlines the arrangements in England for emergency preparedness at this level.Co-operation at the sub-national levelCo-operation at the sub-national level in England is a key element of the UK’s civil
protection framework. The sub-national tier is not a judgement on the local level; rather, it is a mechanism for improving co-ordination and communication into and out from the centre of government.Co-operation at the sub-national level involves the representatives of local responders and central government bodies working together to address larger-scale civil protection issues. Co-operation may take place within a multi-agency setting or directly between 2 or more responders.Role of the sub-national tierThe function of the sub-national tier is to improve co-ordination and communication between central government and local responders and other organisations and to ensure that areas are prepared to respond to events which would affect most or all of the area or which could overwhelm any locality. The successful delivery of the sub-national resilience capability rests critically on local responders and other organisations and central government working together in partnership to ensure effective and co-ordinated planning and response.Opportunities to collaborate and co-operate at a multi-LRF LevelPlanning for and responding to large-scale emergencies cannot be done in isolation in each local resilience forum (LRF). Mechanisms for cross-boundary working and relationship building are essential as some emergencies will overwhelm localities’ resources and/or boundaries.Collaboration and co-operation between localities in England is a well-established and critical way of working in civil contingencies. It is a mechanism:  for enabling pooling of resources to achieve agreed mutual aims and outcomes  for avoiding duplication of work between neighbouring LRFs or avoiding activity by an LRF that may be counter-productive to a neighbouring LRF to support planning and exercising for emergencies that cross local resilience areas or which could overwhelm a locality  that enables individual responders, local forums and central government to work together to address large-scale civil protection issuesDCLG-RED works directly with LRFs, supporting collaboration and co-operation in planning for wide-area high-impact events affecting more than one locality. RED has allocated Resilience Advisers to each LRF so that LRFs have named contacts with which to build working relationships. For more information, see chapter 16 of‘Emerg ency preparedness’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61039/Chapter-16-final-post-consultCCS_amends_16042012.pdf) on collaboration and co-operation between LRFs.

GuidancePreparation and planning for emergencies: responsibilities of responder agencies and othersHow the government prepares and plans for emergencies,working nationally, locally and co-operatively to ensure civil protection in the UK.From: Cabinet Office (/government/organisations/cabinet-office)Published 20 February 2013The Civil Contingencies ActThe Civil Contingencies Act (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents), and accompanying non-legislative measures, delivers a single framework for civil protection in the UK. The Act is separated into 2 substantive parts: local arrangements for civil protection (Part 1); and emergency powers (Part 2).Part 1Part 1 of the Act and supporting Regulations and statutory guidance ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency-preparedness) establish a clear set of roles and responsibilities for those involved in emergency preparation and response at the local level. The Act divides local responders into 2
categories, imposing a different set of duties on each.Those in Category 1 are organisations at the core of the response to most emergencies (the emergency services, local authorities, NHS bodies). Category 1 responders are subject to the full set of civil protection duties. They will be required to:  assess the risk of emergencies occurring and use this to inform contingency planning  put in place emergency plans  put in place business continuity management arrangements  put in place arrangements to make information available to the public about civil protection matters and maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public in the event of an emergency  share information with other local responders to enhance co-ordination  co-operate with other local responders to enhance co-ordination and efficiency  provide advice and assistance to businesses and voluntary organisations aboutbusiness continuity management (local authorities only)Category 2 organisations (the Health and Safety Executive, transport and utility companies) are ‘co-operating bodies’. They are less likely to be involved in the heart of planning work, but will be heavily involved in incidents that affect their own sector. Category 2 responders have a lesser set of duties - co-operating and sharing relevant information with other Category 1 and 2 responders.Category 1 and 2 organisations come together to form ‘local resilience forums’ (based on police areas) which will help co-ordination and co-operation between responders at the local level. For more on what LRFs do and contact details for each, see the guide on ‘Local resilience forums: contact details’ (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-resilience-forums-contact-details).The bulk of Part 1 of the Act was brought into force in November 2005 (the duty on local authorities to provide advice and assistance to business and voluntary organisations about business continuity management commenced in May 2006).Part 2Part 2 of the Act updates the 1920 Emergency Powers Act to reflect the developments in the intervening years and the current and future risk profile. It allows for the making of temporary special legislation (emergency regulations) to help deal with the most serious of emergencies. The use of emergency powers is a last resort option and planning arrangements at the local level should not assume that emergency powers will be made available. Their use is subject to a robust set of safeguards - they can only be deployed in exceptional circumstances.
Part 2 of the Act was brought into force in December 2004.

This section outlines what we mean by emergency planning, different types of plans, the importance of exercising them and training key staff, and the kind of factors which planners should consider.What is emergency planning?Emergency planning should aim where possible to prevent emergencies occurring, and when they do occur, good planning should reduce, control or mitigate the effects of the emergency. It is a systematic and ongoing process which should evolve as lessons are learnt and circumstances change.Emergency planning should be viewed as part of a cycle of activities beginning with establishing a risk profile to help determine what should be the priorities for developing plans and ending with review and revision, which then re-starts the
whole cycle. Plans should focus on at least 3 key groupings of people - the vulnerable, victims (including survivors, family and friends) and responder personnel.Vulnerable people may be less able to help themselves in an emergency than self- reliant people. Those who are vulnerable will vary depending on the nature of the emergency, but plans should consider: those with mobility difficulties (those with physical disabilities or pregnant women); those with mental health difficulties; and others who are dependent, such as children.Victims of an emergency - which includes not only those directly affected but also those who, as family and friends, suffer bereavement or the anxiety of not knowing what has happened.Responder personnel should also be considered. Plans sometimes place unrealistic expectations on management and personnel. Organisations should ensure their plans give due consideration to the welfare of their own personnel. For instance, the emergency services have health and safety procedures which determine shift patterns and check for levels of stress.Organisations should aim to maintain plans which cover 3 different areas:Plans for preventing an emergencyIn some circumstances there will be a short period before an emergency occurs when it might be avoided by prompt or decisive actionPlans for reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency The main bulk of planning should consider how to minimise the effects of an emergency, starting with the impact of the event (ie their alerting procedures) and looking at remedial actions that can be taken to reduce effects. For example, theemergency services may be able to stem the emergency at source by fighting fires, combating the release of toxic chemicals or the extent of floods. The evacuation of people may be a direct intervention which can mitigate the effects of some emergencies. Recovery plans should also be developed to reduce the effects of the emergency and ensure long term recovery. The National Recovery Guidance (http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/national-recovery-g uidance) provides more detail on recovery issues.Plans for taking other action in connection with an emergencyNot all actions to be taken in preparing for an emergency are directly concerned with controlling, reducing or mitigating its effects. Emergency planning should look beyond the immediate response and long term recovery issues and look also at secondary impacts. For example, the wave of reaction to an emergency can be quite overwhelming in terms of media attention and public response. Plans may need to consider how to handle this increased interest.As obvious as it sounds, emergency plans should include procedures for determining whether an emergency has occurred, and when to activate the plan in
response to an emergency. This should include identifying an appropriately trained person who will take the decision, in consultation with others, on when an emergency has occurred.The maintenance of plans involves more than just their preparation. Once a plan has been prepared, it must be maintained systematically to ensure it remains up-to-date and fit for purpose at any time if an emergency occurs.It may be that multiple organisations can develop a joint emergency plan where the partners agree that, for a successful combined response, they need a formal set of procedures governing them all. For example, in the event that evacuation is required, the police would need carefully pre-planned co-operation from various other organisations such as fire and ambulance services and the local authority, as well as involvement of others such as transport organisations.Types of emergency plansIt may be important for an organisation to have more than one emergency plan. It is often the case that organisations have generic plans and more specific plans.Generic plans are the core plan which enables the organisation to respond to, and recover from a wide range of possible emergencies. They should include procedures which would be used in all instances for ensuring the welfare of staff and the provision of sufficient resources for responding to the emergency.Specific plans relate either to a particular emergency or kind of emergency, or to a specific site or location. Specific plans are a detailed set of arrangements designed to go beyond the generic arrangements when they are likely to prove insufficient in a particular case. A specific plan usually builds on a generic plan. For example, organisations which deal with hazardous materials may need specific plans for responding to a chemical spillage. Some organisations may have specific plans for conducting specific functions in response to an emergency. For instance, the emergency services will have plans for mass evacuation of an urban area and mass decontamination. Organisations should use their risk assessments to decide whether specific plans are necessary or desirable.Exercising plans and training staffOrganisations should test the effectiveness of their emergency plans by carrying out exercises, and should ensure that staff involved in the planning for or response to an emergency receive appropriate training. Training plans should also consider other people who have a role in the emergency plans such as contractors and civil protection partners. The plans themselves should explicitly identify the nature and frequency of training and exercising required. The guide Emerg ency planning and preparedness: exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and- preparedness-exercises-and-training) provides more information.
Emergency planning at the local levelEmergency planning is at the heart of the civil protection duty on Category 1 responders under the Civil Contingencies Act. The Act requires Category 1 responders to maintain plans for preventing emergencies; reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of emergencies; and taking other action in the event of emergencies. These should draw on risk assessments and should have regard for the arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public at the time of an emerg ency (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme#warning-and-informing-the-public).The Regulations require plans to contain a procedure for determining whether an emergency has occurred; provision for training key staff; and provision for exercising the plan to ensure it is effective. Procedures should also be put in place to ensure that the plan is reviewed periodically and kept up to date.Category 1 responders should involve Category 2 responders - and other organisations which are not subject to the Act’s requirements - as appropriate throughout the planning process. Category 1 responders are specifically required to have regard to the activities of relevant voluntary organisations when developing plans. The Regulations permit Category 1 responders to collaborate with other organisations in delivering the emergency planning duty.Category 1 responders also have a statutory duty to publish their emergency plans, to the extent necessary or desirable for the purpose of dealing with an emergency.Emergency planning at the sub-national levelPlanning at a multi-LRF level is different from planning at the local level. For more information on the sub-national tier, see the Arrangements in England (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-responsibilities-of-responder- agencies-and-others#arrangements-in-england) section.Emergency planning in the devolved administrationsIt is equally important that organisations within the devolved administrations conduct effective emergency planning. The devolved administrations section below provides more detail on the extent to which the Civil Contingencies Act duties apply and their individual emergency planning arrangements.The government works closely with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to promote effective emergency planning that is, as far as possible, consistent with that of the rest of the UK.Emergency planning at the UK government level
The UK government capabilities programme is the core framework through which the government is seeking to build resilience across all parts of the UK. The programme uses risk assessment over a 5-year period to identify the generic capabilities that underpin the UK’s resilience to disruptive challenges, and ensures that each of these is developed. These capabilities include dealing with mass casualties and fatalities, response to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear incidents, provision of essential services and warning and informing the public. A full list of the current capabilities can be found in this g uide to the capabilities programme (https://www.gov.uk/preparation-and-planning-for-emerg encies-the-capabilities- programme).The government has in place a coordinated cross-governmental exercise programme covering a comprehensive range of domestic disruptive challenges, including accidents, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. The programme is designed to test rigorously the concept of operations from the coordinated central response through the range of lead government department responsibilities and the involvement of the devolved administrations, to the sub-national tier and local responders. More information is provided in the g uide to emerg ency exercises and training (https://www.gov.uk/emerg ency-planning-and-preparedness-exercises-and-training).These national processes feed into the devolved administrations, sub-national and local levels to ensure fully integrated emergency planning at all levels throughout the UK.The role of the voluntary sector in emergency planning and responseWhere appropriate, organisations should consider at an early stage in planning whether voluntary organisations may have capabilities which could assist in responding to an emergency.The voluntary sector can provide a wide range of skills and services in responding to an emergency. These include: practical support (such as first aid, transportation, or provisions for responders); psycho-social support (such as counselling and helplines); equipment (radios, medical equipment); and information services (such as public training and communications).Existing emergency planning dutiesThe Civil Contingencies Act Regulations identify 3 pieces of legislation pre-dating this Act which were introduced separately in Britain and Northern Ireland under sector-specific legislation operated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and HSE Northern Ireland. These relate to major accident hazards at industrial establishments (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (COMAH)), to hazardous pipelines (Pipelines Safety Regulations) and to radiation hazards (Radiation (Emergency Preparation and Public Information) Regulations (REPPIR)). These sector-specific Regulations have established multi-agency emergency planning regimes in co-operation with the operators. To avoid duplication, the Civil
Contingencies Act Regulations provide that the duty to maintain plans under the Act does not apply to emergencies which are dealt with by these pieces of legislation.For more information on how the Act fits with other legislation see chapter 19 of ‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Important documentsEmerg ency Preparedness (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness)  Chapter 5: “Emergency planning”  Annex 5a: “Examples of generic and specific plans”  Annex 5B: “Generic plan: emergency or major incident”  Annex 5C: “Specific plan”  Annex 5D: “Example of a plan maintenance matrix for a local authority”Chapter 7 “Communicating with the public” - Contains further detail on communicating with the vulnerable and victims in an emergency  Annex 7A: “Communicating with the public: the national context “  Annex 7B: “Lead responsibility for warning and informing the public”  Annex 7C: “Checklist of suggested protocols”Chapter 14: “The role of the voluntary sector” Annex 14A: “Examples of voluntary sector activities in support of statutory services”  Home Office document Recovery: an emerg ency management guide(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recovery-an-emerg ency-management-g uide)  Communicating risk guidance(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/communicating-risk-g uidance) Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm) - a guide to emergency planning arrangements, risk assessment and other documentation is available on this website London’s strategic emerg ency plan (http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/london- prepared/home)Devolved administrationsThis section describes emergency preparedness and planning arrangements in the devolved administrations, where these differ from UK government and local
arrangements in England. It also outlines how Part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act and its associated Regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. More detail on the specific duties under the Act and how they apply in the Devolved Administrations can be found in chapters 2 to 8 of the guidance document‘Emerg ency preparedness’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerg ency- preparedness).Emergency preparedness in ScotlandIn devolved areas the Scottish government is designated as the lead on relevant issues in line with the ‘lead department’ principle at the UK level. In reserved areas the Scottish government works closely with the UK government to ensure that Scottish needs are catered for.Overall responsibility for civil protection policy in Scotland sits with the Scottish Resilience Division of the Scottish government.At the local level in Scotland, 8 strategic coordinating groups based on current police force areas promote effective planning for all types of incidents in their area, involving risk assessment, making generic and specific emergency plans, engaging with the community, training, testing, exercising and reviewing.  Scottish government civil emerg encies website(http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/public-safety/emerg encies)Emergency preparedness in WalesThe Welsh government (WG) or Wales Office, depending on the subject matter, is represented on relevant committees and forums within the UK government relating to civil protection. They work closely with UK government departments to ensure that UK civil protection policy and planning is tailored to Welsh needs. A dedicated team in WG supports multi-agency co-operation in Wales and engagement with the UK government on issues relating to civil protection and emergency preparedness.As in England, local resilience forums (LRFs) are the principle mechanism for multi- agency co-operation on civil protection issues. The respective Chief Constables presently chair the LRFs in the South Wales, North Wales, Dyfed-Powys and Gwent areas. The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi- agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum meets quarterly and is chaired by the First Minister or the Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration. Risk assessment at a pan-Wales level is undertaken by the Wales Risk Assessment Group (WRAG) reporting to the WRF.A number of other groups provide forums for discussion and co-ordination of civil protection in Wales, including: the Joint Emergency Services Group; the Wales Media Emergency Forum; and the Welsh Borders Resilience Group.
  Welsh civil emerg encies website (https://gov.wales/wales-resilience-forum)Emergency preparedness in Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) in the UK government is, however, responsible for, amongst other things, policing, criminal justice and security in Northern Ireland.The Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (CCPB) in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) promotes and co-ordinates civil protection arrangements in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland government would normally have oversight of civil contingencies arrangements for transferred functions. The ‘lead government department’ principle applies to Northern Ireland departments as at the UK level.The Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is a pan-Northern Ireland multi-agency forum for the development, discussion and agreement of civil protection policy. Co-ordination at local and sub-regional levels may be facilitated by a range of organisations, with police district commanders and district council chief executives taking key roles in co-ordination. Northern Ireland has its own unique constitutional and organisational structures. Unlike in Great Britain, many services are delivered on a Northern Ireland-wide (regional) basis, either by government departments or by their agencies and NDPBs.  Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Policy Branch website(http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-g overnment-work/civil-contingencies.htm)The devolved administrations under the Civil Contingencies Act ScotlandPart 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act applies to Scotland, with the powers it sets out residing with Scottish Ministers in line with the devolution settlement. While civil protection in Scotland is largely a devolved matter and therefore the responsibility of the Scottish government, certain responders in Scotland are subject to Part 1 of the Act, the Regulations and guidance issued by UK ministers - the Health and Safety Executive, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the British Transport Police.WalesThe arrangements set out in Part 1 of the Act apply in Wales. However, there are some differences in the requirements which the Regulations place on Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales because of the unique administrative arrangements in Wales. As in England, the principal mechanism for co-operation between Category 1 and 2 responders under the Act will be the local resilience forums (LRFs). The Welsh Resilience Forum (WRF) provides a national forum for multi-agency strategic advice on civil protection and emergency planning. The forum is a non-statutory advisory body.
Northern IrelandCivil contingencies in Northern Ireland are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. The duties of the Act apply only to a limited number of organisations which deliver functions that are not transferred. These organisations are: the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI); the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA); and telecommunications operators. Because these organisations do not represent the full spectrum of response agencies in Northern Ireland, the Regulations treat these organisations in a slightly different way. In practice, it is anticipated that the PSNI, MCA and telecommunications operators in Northern Ireland will undertake their duties under the Act, but will relate to the other public service bodies listed in the Regulations in line with the arrangements in the Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework and by participating in Northern Ireland co-operation, co-ordination and crisis management machinery.Further informationYou can find further details on all of the above in these documents: ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: devolution concordat with Scottish Ministers’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act-2004-devolution-  concordat-with-scottish-ministers) ‘Civil Contingencies Act 2004: concordat between the UK government and the Welsh government’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-contingencies-act- 2004-concordat-between-the-uk-g overnment-and-the-welsh-g overnment) ‘Emerg ency preparedness - chapter 10: Scotland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61033/Chap  ter-10-Scotland-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 11: Wales’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61034/Ch  apter-11-Wales-amends-10112011.pdf) ‘Chapter 12: Northern Ireland’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61035/Ch  apter-12-Northern-ireland-amends-10112011.pdf)Co-operation for emergency preparednessCo-operation between organisations is fundamental to emergency preparedness. A large number of organisations will need to co-operate when responding to emergencies, so it is right that organisations co-operate closely in preparedness and planning as well. The government aims to ensure all organisations co-operate in emergency preparedness, and robust co-operation arrangements are in place at every level. This section outlines who should co-operate, and how. It describes co- operation arrangements in place locally and points out the emphasis placed on co- operation within the Civil Contingencies Act.
Who should co-operate?Organisations will need to co-operate closely with any other organisation who would be involved in responding to and recovering from an emergency which affects that organisation.That will mean not just partner organisations, but contractors, and voluntary organisations who may be involved in the response. Organisations should consider their need to co-operate with a wide range of public (for example, local authorities, emergency services), commercial (for example, other businesses) and voluntary organisations (like charities and voluntary response organisations).What co-operation?Every-day co-operation between organisations is the lifeblood of civil protection work- through visits and seminars, phone calls and emails, and joint projects including exercises.Many organisations are well used to co-operating in both preparing for and responding to emergencies. The emergency services, for instance, obviously co- ordinate closely when responding to emergencies. They also co-operate closely in policy and planning, and undertake joint training and exercises. Likewise, utilities companies have close links with local authorities and the emergency services.Organisations should aim to co-operate bilaterally and attend multi-agency groups and forums to discuss co-ordinated and sometimes joint approaches to the essential aspects of emergency preparedness - risk assessment, emergency planning, business continuity management, and arrangements to warn and inform the public. Such forums should also consider producing multi-agency plans and other documents, including protocols and agreements, and the co-ordination of multi- agency exercises and other training events.Co-operation at the local level under the Civil Contingencies ActThe principle mechanism for multi-agency co-operation at the local level is the local resilience forum (LRF) (https://www.gov.uk/local-resilience-forums-contact-details). LRFs are generally based on local police areas, and bring together all the organisations who have a duty to co-operate under the Civil Contingencies Act, along with others who would be involved in the response.The purpose of the LRF process is to ensure effective delivery of those duties under the Act that need to be developed in a multi-agency environment.Co-operation at the sub-national level
Some co-operation and co-ordination takes place at multi-LRF level in England, which brings together representatives of local responders, and is supported by resilience advisers from DCLG-RED (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies), to work together to address larger-scale civil protection issues.Co-operation at the devolved administration levelSimilar co-operation and co-ordination arrangements are in place in the devolved administrations. For instance, in Scotland strategic co-ordinating groups are similar to LRFs, and the Scottish Emergencies Co-ordinating Committee (SECC) provides co-ordination and determines the national strategy for the development of civil protection. In Wales the Welsh Government (WG) provides that co-ordination, and a Wales Resilience Forum brings together local responders and UK government bodies. In Northern Ireland the Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is the forum for the development, discussion and agreement of Civil Protection Policy for the NI public services.Co-operation at the UK levelGovernment departments who are responsible for contingency planning and response within their own areas (for example, infectious diseases falls to Department of Health; fuel disruptions falls to Business Innovation and Skills), work closely together. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) in the Cabinet Office co- ordinates their work to enhance the country’s resilience to the full range of emergencies.Central government works very closely with the devolved administrations, local authorities and emergency services. Officials attend the full range of multi-agency forums and regularly go out to visit practitioners.Arrangements in EnglandThe Department for Communities and Local Government - Resilience and Emerg encies Division (DCLG-RED) (https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/working- with-local-partners-to-plan-for-and-respond-to-emerg encies) provides the platform formulti-LRF co-operation and planning in emergency preparedness where this would add value by improving co-ordination between local and central response. This section outlines the arrangements in England for emergency preparedness at this level.Co-operation at the sub-national levelCo-operation at the sub-national level in England is a key element of the UK’s civil
protection framework. The sub-national tier is not a judgement on the local level; rather, it is a mechanism for improving co-ordination and communication into and out from the centre of government.Co-operation at the sub-national level involves the representatives of local responders and central government bodies working together to address larger-scale civil protection issues. Co-operation may take place within a multi-agency setting or directly between 2 or more responders.Role of the sub-national tierThe function of the sub-national tier is to improve co-ordination and communication between central government and local responders and other organisations and to ensure that areas are prepared to respond to events which would affect most or all of the area or which could overwhelm any locality. The successful delivery of the sub-national resilience capability rests critically on local responders and other organisations and central government working together in partnership to ensure effective and co-ordinated planning and response.Opportunities to collaborate and co-operate at a multi-LRF LevelPlanning for and responding to large-scale emergencies cannot be done in isolation in each local resilience forum (LRF). Mechanisms for cross-boundary working and relationship building are essential as some emergencies will overwhelm localities’ resources and/or boundaries.Collaboration and co-operation between localities in England is a well-established and critical way of working in civil contingencies. It is a mechanism:  for enabling pooling of resources to achieve agreed mutual aims and outcomes  for avoiding duplication of work between neighbouring LRFs or avoiding activity by an LRF that may be counter-productive to a neighbouring LRF to support planning and exercising for emergencies that cross local resilience areas or which could overwhelm a locality  that enables individual responders, local forums and central government to work together to address large-scale civil protection issuesDCLG-RED works directly with LRFs, supporting collaboration and co-operation in planning for wide-area high-impact events affecting more than one locality. RED has allocated Resilience Advisers to each LRF so that LRFs have named contacts with which to build working relationships. For more information, see chapter 16 of‘Emerg ency preparedness’(https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61039/Chapter-16-final-post-consultCCS_amends_16042012.pdf) on collaboration and co-operation between LRFs.

The call-handling centres are owned by BT Plc, who operate the service on behalf of all the communications providers (mobile, fixed line and broadband). An agent at one of the BT Plc call-handling centres responds with “emergency, which service?”. The geographic location of the caller, which is normally automatically available, enables the call to be transferred to the relevant geographically located emergency service control room.Ofcom, the independent communications regulator, oversees regulation of the
telecommunications aspects of the 999-112 service through the General Conditions of Entitlement (https://www.ofcom.org .uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/information-for- industry/telecoms-competition-regulation/general-conditions-of-entitlement).The statistics - 202341.9 million999/112 calls a year, of which:79%from mobile15%from landline134,000eCalls (included in mobile %)Service	Percentage of callsPolice	57%Ambulance	40%Fire	3%Coastguard	<1%7 BT call centres.142 local emergency services control rooms.

How to use this guideThis guide is divided into two parts:ï Part 1 Explains what fire risk assessment is and how you might go about it. Fire risk assessment should be the foundation for all the fire precautions in your premises.ï Part 2 Provides further guidance on fire precautions. The information is provided for you and others to dip into during your fire risk assessment or when you are reviewing your precautions.The appendices provide example checklists, some detailed technical information on fire-resisting elements and advice on historic buildings.This guide is one of a series of guides listed on the back cover. The rest of this introduction explains how the law applies.Technical terms are explained in the glossary and references to other publications listed at the end of the publication are identified by a superscript number in the text.In this guide reference is made to British Standards and standards provided by other bodies. The standards referred to are intended for guidance only and other standards could be used. Reference to any particular standard is not intended to confer a presumption of conformity with the requirements of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (the Order)1.The level of necessary safety (or service) must be dictated by the findings of your risk assessment so you may need to do more or less than that specified in any particular standard referred to. You must be prepared to show that what you have done complies with any requirements or prohibitions of the Order1 irrespective of whether you have relied on a particular standard.A full list of references, e.g.1, can be found at the back of this book.
PrefaceThis guidance gives advice on how to avoid fires and how to ensure people’s safety if a fire does start. Why should you read it? Because:ï Fire kills. In 2004 (England and Wales) fire and rescue services attended over 33,400 fires in non-domestic buildings. These fires killed 38 people and injured over 1,300.ï Fire costs money. The costs of a serious fire can be high and afterwards many businesses do not reopen. In 2004, the costs as a consequence of fire, including property damage, human casualties and lost business, were estimated at£2.5 billion.This guide applies to England and Wales only. It does not set prescriptive standards, but provides recommendations and guidance for use when assessing the adequacy of fire precautions in offices and shops. Other fire risk assessment methods may be equally valid to comply with fire safety law. The guide also provides recommendations for the fire safety management of the premises.Your existing fire safety arrangements may not be the same as the recommendations used in this guide but, as long as you can demonstrate that they meet an equivalent standard of fire safety, they are likely to be acceptable. If you decide that your existing arrangements are not satisfactory there may be other ways to comply with fire safety law. This means there is no obligation to adopt any particular solution in this guide if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way.Where the building has been recently constructed or significantly altered, the fire detection and warning arrangements, escape routes and facilities for the fire and rescue service should have been designed, constructed and installed in accordance with current building regulations. In such cases, it is likely that these measures will be satisfactory as long as they are being properly maintained and no significant increase in risk has been introduced.In addition, earlier legislation, including local authorities acts may have imposed additional requirements for fire precautions in large offices and shops.This guide should not be used to design fire safety in new buildings. Where alterations are proposed to existing offices and shops, they may be subject to building regulations. However, it can be used to develop the fire safety strategy for the building.
IntroductionWHO SHOULD USE THIS GUIDE?This guide is for all employers, managers, occupiers and owners of offices and shops. Details of other guides in the series are listed on the back cover. It tells you about how you might comply with fire safety law, helps you to carry out a fire risk assessment and identify the general fire precautions you need to have in place.This guide is intended for premises where the main use of the building or partof the building is an office or shop. It may also be suitable for the individual units within other complexes, although consultation with the other managers will be necessary as part of an integrated risk assessment for the complex.Also, where you handle and store flammable materials and substances, it will help you take account of these in your risk assessment and help you determine the necessary precautions to take to minimise the likelihood of them being involvedin a fire.It has been written to provide guidance for a responsible person, to help them to carry out a fire risk assessment in less complex offices and shops. If you read the guide and decide that you are unable to apply the guidance, then you should seek expert advice from a competent person. More complex premises will probably need to be assessed by a person who has comprehensive training or experience in fire risk assessment. However this guide can be used for multi-occupied buildings to address fire safety issues within their individual occupancies.It may also be useful for:ï employees;ï employee-elected representatives;ï trade union-appointed health and safety representatives;ï enforcing authorities; andï all other people who have a role in ensuring fire safety in offices and shops.If your premises are listed as of historic interest, also see Appendix C.Fire safety is only one of many safety issues with which management must concern themselves to minimise the risk of injury or death to staff or the public. Unlike most of the other safety concerns, fire has the potential to injure or kill large numbers of people very quickly. This guidance is concerned only with fire safety but many of the measures discussed here will impact upon other safety issues, and vice versa. It is recognised that these various differing safety demands can sometimes affect one another and managerment should consult other interested agencies (e.g. Health & Safety Executive (HSE)) where necessary to confirm that they are not contravening other legislation/guidance.
You can get advice about minimising fire losses from your insurer.THE FIRE SAFETY ORDERPrevious general fire safety legislationThe Order1 replaces previous fire safety legislation. Any fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 19712 will cease to have any effect. If a fire certificate has been issued in respect of your premises or the premises were built to recent building regulations, as long as you have made no material alterations and all the physical fire precautions have been properly maintained, then it is unlikely you will need to make any significant improvements to your existing physical fire protection arrangements to comply with the Order.1 However, you must still carry out a fire risk assessment and keep it up to date to ensure that all the fire precautions in your premises remain current and adequate.If you have previously carried out a fire risk assessment under the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997,3 as amended 1999,4 and this assessment has been regularly reviewed then all you will need to do now is revise that assessment taking account of the wider scope of the Order1 as described in this guide.Your premises may also be subject to the provisions of a licence or registration (e.g. under the Licensing Act 200378) of the case, and the fire authority may wish to review your risk assessment as part of the licensing approval process. Fire safety conditions within your licence should not be set by a licensing authority where the Order1 applies.BackgroundThe Order1 applies in England and Wales. It covers general fire precautions and other fire safety duties which are needed to protect ‘relevant persons’ in case of fire in and around most ‘premises’. The Order requires fire precautions to be put in place ‘where necessary’ and to the extent that it is reasonable and practicable in the circumstances of the case.Responsibility for complying with the Order1 rests with the ‘responsible person’. In a workplace, this is the employer and any other person who may have control of any part of the premises, e.g. the occupier or owner. In all other premises the person or people in control of the premises will be responsible. If there is more than one responsible person in any type of premises (e.g. a multi-occupied complex), all must take all reasonable steps to co-operate and co-ordinate with each other.If you are the responsible person you must carry out a fire risk assessment which must focus on the safety in case of fire of all ‘relevant persons’. It should pay particular attention to those at special risk, such as disabled people, those who you know have special needs and young persons and must include consideration of any dangerous substance liable to be on the premises. Your fire risk assessment will help you identify risks that can be removed or reduced and to decide the nature and extent of the general fire precautions you need to take.
If your organisation employs five or more people, your premises are licensed or an alterations notice is in force, you must record the significant findings of the assessment. It is good practice to record your significant findings in any case.There are some other fire safety duties you need to comply with:ï You must appoint one or more competent persons, depending on the size and use of your premises, to carry out any of the preventive and protective measures required by the Order1 (you can nominate yourself for this purpose). A competent person is someone with enough training and experience or knowledge and other qualities to be able to implement these measures properly.ï You must provide your employees with clear and relevant information on the risks to them identified by the fire risk assessment, about the measures you have taken to prevent fires, and how these measures will protect them if a fire breaks out.ï You must consult your employees (or their elected representatives) about nominating people to carry out particular roles in connection with fire safety and about proposals for improving the fire precautions.ï You must, before you employ a child, provide a parent with clear and relevant information on the risks to that child identified by the risk assessment, the measures you have put in place to prevent/protect them from fire and inform any other responsible person of any risks to that child arising from their undertaking.ï You must inform non-employees, such as temporary or contract workers, of the relevant risks to them, and provide them with information about who are thenominated competent persons, and about the fire safety procedures for the premises.ï You must co-operate and co-ordinate with other responsible persons who also have premises in the building, inform them of any significant risks you find and how you will seek to reduce/control those risks which might affect the safety of their employees.ï You must provide the employer of any person from an outside organisation who is working in your premises (e.g. an agency providing temporary staff) withclear and relevant information on the risks to those employees and the preventive and protective measures taken. You must also provide those employees with appropriate instructions and relevant information about the risks to them.ï If you are not the employer but have any control of premises which contain more than one workplace, you are also responsible for ensuring that the requirementsof the Order1 are complied with in those parts over which you have control.ï You must consider the presence of any dangerous substances and the risk this presents to relevant persons from fire.ï You must establish a suitable means of contacting the emergency services and provide them with any relevant information about dangerous substances.ï 
ï You must provide appropriate information, instruction and training to your employees, during their normal working hours, about the fire precautions in your workplace, when they start working for you, and from time to time throughout the period they work for you.ï You must ensure that the premises and any equipment provided in connection with firefighting, fire detection and warning, or emergency routes and exits are covered by a suitable system of maintenance and are maintained by a competent person in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair.ï Your employees must co-operate with you to ensure the workplace is safe from fire and its effects, and must not do anything that will place themselves or other people at risk.The above examples outline some of the main requirements of the Order.1 The rest of this guide will explain how you might meet these requirements.Who enforces the Fire Safety Order?The local fire and rescue authority (the fire and rescue service) will enforce the Order1 in most premises. The exceptions are:ï Crown-occupied/owned premises where Crown fire inspectors will enforce;ï premises within armed forces establishments where the defence fire and rescue service will enforce;ï certain specialist premises including construction sites, ships (under repair or construction) and nuclear installations, where the HSE will enforce; andï sports grounds and stands designated as needing a safety certificate by the local authority, where the local authority will enforce.The enforcing authority will have the power to inspect your premises to check that you are complying with your duties under the Order.1 They will look for evidence that you have carried out a suitable fire risk assessment and acted upon the significant findings of that assessment. If you are required to record the outcome of the assessment they will expect to see a copy.If the enforcing authority is dissatisfied with the outcome of your fire risk assessment or the action you have taken, they may issue an enforcement notice that requires you to make certain improvements or, in extreme cases, a prohibition notice that restricts the use of all or part of your premises until improvements are made.If your premises are considered by the enforcing authority to be or have potential to be high risk, they may issue an alterations notice that requires you to inform them before you make any changes to your premises or the way they are used.Failure to comply with any duty imposed by the Order1 or any notice issued by the enforcing authority is an offence. You have a right of appeal to a magistrates court against any notice issued. Where you agree that there is a need for improvements to your fire precautions but disagree with the enforcing authority on the technical solution to be used (e.g. what type of fire alarm system is needed) you may agree to refer this for independent determination.
If having read this guide you are in any doubt about how fire safety law applies to you, contact the fire safety office at your local fire and rescue service.If your premises were in use before 2006, then they may have been subject to the Fire Precautions Act2 and the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations.3,4 Where the layout (means of escape) and other fire precautions have been assessed by the fire and rescue service to satisfy the guidance that was then current, then it is likely that your premises already conform to many of the recommendations here, providing you have undertaken a fire risk assessment as required by the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations.3,4New buildings or significant building alterations should be designed to satisfy current building regulations24 (which address fire precautions).However, you will still need to carry out a fire risk assessment, or review your existing assessment (and act on your findings), to comply with the Order.1
Part 1 Fire risk assessmentMANAGING FIRE SAFETYGood management of fire safety is essential to ensure that fires are unlikely to occur; that if they do occur they are likely to be controlled or contained quickly, effectively and safely; or that, if a fire does occur and grow, everyone in your premises is able to escape to a place of total safety easily and quickly.The risk assessment that you must carry out will help you ensure that your fire safety procedures, fire prevention measures, and fire precautions (plans, systems and equipment) are all in place and working properly, and the risk assessment should identify any issues that need attention. Further information on managing fire safety is available in Part 2 on page 39.WHAT IS A FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT?A fire risk assessment is an organised and methodical look at your premises, the activities carried on there and the likelihood that a fire could start and cause harm to those in and around the premises.The aims of the fire risk assessment are:ï To identify the fire hazards.ï To reduce the risk of those hazards causing harm to as low as reasonably practicable.ï To decide what physical fire precautions and management arrangements are necessary to ensure the safety of people in your premises if a fire does start.The term ‘where necessary’ (see Glossary) is used in the Order,1 therefore when deciding what fire precautions and management arrangements are necessary you will need to take account of this definition.The terms ‘hazard’ and ‘risk’ are used throughout this guide and it is important that you have a clear understanding of how these should be used.ï Hazard: anything that has the potential to cause harm.ï Risk: the chance of that harm occurring.If your organisation employs five or more people, or your premises are licensed or an alterations notice requiring it is in force, then the significant findings of the fire risk assessment, the actions to be taken as a result of the assessment and details of anyone especially at risk must be recorded. You will probably find it helpful to keep a record of the significant findings of your fire risk assessment even if you are not required to do so.HOW DO YOU CARRY OUT A FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT?A fire risk assessment will help you determine the chances of a fire starting and the dangers from fire that your premises present for the people who use them and any
person in the immediate vicinity. The assessment method suggested in this guide shares the same approach as that used in general health and safety legislation and can be carried out either as part of a more general risk assessment or as a separate exercise. As you move through the steps there are checklists to help you.Before you start your fire risk assessment, take time to prepare, and read through the rest of Part 1 of this guide.Much of the information for your fire risk assessment will come from the knowledge your employees, colleagues and representatives have of the premises, as well as information given to you by people who have responsibility for other parts of the building. A tour of your premises will probably be needed to confirm, amend or add detail to your initial views.It is important that you carry out your fire risk assessment in a practical and systematic way and that you allocate enough time to do a proper job. It must take the whole of your premises into account, including outdoor locations and any rooms and areas that are rarely used. If your premises are small you may be able to assess them as a whole. In larger premises you may find it helpful to divide them into rooms or a series of assessment areas using natural boundaries, e.g. process areas (such as bakeries and cooking facilities in shops), offices, stores, as well as corridors, stairways and external routes.If your premises are in a multi-use complex then the information on hazard and risk reduction will still be applicable to you. However, any alterations to the use or structure of your individual unit will need to take account of the overall fire safety arrangements in the building.Your premises may be simple, with few people present or with a limited degree of business activity, but if it forms part of a building with different occupancies, then the measures provided by other occupiers may have a direct effect on the adequacy of the fire safety measures in your premises.Under health and safety law (enforced by the HSE or the local authority) you are required to carry out a risk assessment in respect of any work processes in your workplace and to take or observe appropriate special, technical or organisational measures. If your health and safety risk assessment identifies that these processes are likely to involve the risk of fire or the spread of fire then you will need to take this into account during your fire risk assessment under the Order,1 and prioritise actions based on the level of risk.You need to appoint one or more competent persons (this could be you) to carry out any of the preventive and protective measures needed to comply with the Order.1 This person could be you, or an appropriately trained, employee or, where appropriate, a third party.Your fire risk assessment should demonstrate that, as far as is reasonable, you have considered the needs of all relevant persons, including disabled people.Figure 1 shows the five steps you need to take to carry out a fire risk assessment.

For a fire to start, three things are needed:ï a source of ignition;ï fuel; andï oxygen.If any one of these is missing, a fire cannot start. Taking measures to avoid the three coming together will therefore reduce the chances of a fire occurring.
The remainder of this step will advise on how to identify potential ignition sources, the materials that might fuel a fire and the oxygen supplies that will help it burn.
Figure 2: The fire triangle
1.1 Identify sources of ignitionYou can identify the potential ignition sources in your premises by looking for possible sources of heat which could get hot enough to ignite material found in your premises. These sources could include:ï smokers’ material, e.g. cigarettes, matches and lighters;ï naked flames, e.g. candles or gas or liquid-fuelled open-flame equipment;ï electrical, gas or oil-fired heaters (fixed or portable);ï hot processes, e.g. welding by contractors or shrink wrapping;ï cooking equipment;ï faulty or misused electrical equipment;ï lighting equipment, e.g. halogen lamps or display lighting too close to stored products;ï hot surfaces and obstruction of equipment ventilation, e.g. office equipment; andï arson.
Indications of ‘near-misses’, such as scorch marks on furniture or fittings, discoloured or charred electrical plugs and sockets, cigarette burns etc.,can help you identify hazards which you may not otherwise notice.
Figure 3: Sources of ignition
1.2 Identify sources of fuelAnything that burns is fuel for a fire. You need to look for the things that will burn reasonably easily and are in enough quantity to provide fuel for a fire or cause it to spread to another fuel source. Some of the most common ‘fuels’ found in offices and shops are:ï flammable-liquid-based products, such as paints, varnishes, thinners and adhesives;ï flammable liquids and solvents, such as white spirit, methylated spirit, cooking oils and disposable cigarette lighters;ï flammable chemicals, such as certain cleaning products, photocopier chemicals and dry cleaning that uses hydrocarbon solvents;ï packaging materials, stationery, advertising material and decorations;ï plastics and rubber, such as video tapes, polyurethane foam-filled furniture and polystyrene-based display materials;ï textiles and soft furnishings, such as hanging curtains and clothing displays;ï waste products, particularly finely divided items such as shredded paper and wood shavings, off cuts, and dust; andï flammable gases such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).You should also consider the materials used to line walls and ceilings, e.g. polystyrene or carpet tiles, the fixtures and fittings, and how they might contribute to the spread of fire. Further information is available in Part 2, Section 1.1.3 Identify sources of oxygenThe main source of oxygen for a fire is in the air around us. In an enclosed building this is provided by theventilation system in use. This generally falls into one of two categories: natural airflow through doors, windows and other openings; or mechanical air conditioning systems and air handling systems. In many buildings there will be a combination of systems, which will be capable of introducing/extracting air to and from the building.
Additional sources of oxygen can sometimes be found in materials used or stored at premises such as:ï some chemicals (oxidising materials), which can provide a fire with additional
Figure 4: Label on oxidising materials
oxygen and so help it burn. These chemicals should be identified on their container (and Control of Substances Hazardous to Health data sheet, see Figure 4) by the manufacturer or supplier who can advise as to their safe use and storage;
ï oxygen supplies from cylinder storage and piped systems, e.g. oxygen used in welding processes; andï pyrotechnics (fireworks), which contain oxidising materials and need to be treated with great care.As part of your fire risk assessment, you need to identify those at risk if there is a fire. To do this you need to identify where you have people working, either at permanent workstations or at occasional locations around the premises, and to consider who else may be at risk, such as customers, visiting contractors etc., and where these people are likely to be found.You must consider all the people who use the premsies but you should pay particular attention to people who may be especially at risk such as:ï employees who work alone and/or in isolated areas, e.g. cleaners, security staff;ï people who are unfamiliar with the premises, e.g. seasonal workers, contractors, visitors and customers;ï people with disabilities14* or those who may have some other reason for not being able to leave the premises quickly, e.g. elderly customers or parents with children;ï other persons in the immediate vicinity of the premises; andï people with language difficulties.In evaluating the risk to people with disabilities you may need to discuss their individual needs with them. In larger buildings used extensively by the public you may need to seek professional advice.Further guidance on people with special needs is given in Part 2, Section 1.* Visit the Disability Rights Commission website on www.drc-gb.org for more information.
The management of the premises and the way people use it will have an effect on your evaluation of risk. Management may be your responsibility alone or there may be others, such as the building owners or managing agents, who also have responsibilities. In multi-occupied buildings all those with some control mustco-operate and you need to consider the risk generated by others in the building.3.1 Evaluate the risk of a fire occuringThe chances of a fire starting will be low if your premises has few ignition sources and combustible materials are kept away from them.In general, fires start in one of three ways:ï accidentally, such as when smoking materials are not properly extinguished or when lighting displays are knocked over;ï by act or omission, such as when electrical office equipment is not properly maintained, or when waste packaging is allowed to accumulate near to a heat source; andï deliberately, such as an arson attack involving setting fire to external rubbish bins placed too close to the building.Look critically at your premises and try to identify any accidents waiting to happen and any acts or omissions which might allow a fire to start. You should also look for any situation that may present an opportunity for an arsonistFurther guidance in Part 2, Section 1 on evaluating the risk of a fire starting.3.2 Evaluate the risk to peopleIn Step 2 you identified the people likely to be at risk should a fire start anywhere in the premises and earlier in Step 3 you identified the chances of a fire occurring. It is unlikely that you will have concluded that there is no chance of a fire starting anywhere in your premises so you now need to evaluate the actual risk to those people should a fire start and spread from the various locations that you have identified.While determining the possible incidents, you should also consider the likelihood of any particular incident; but be aware that some very unlikely incidents can put many people at risk.To evaluate the risk to people in your premises, you will need to understand the way fire can spread. Fire is spread by three methods:ï convection;ï conduction; andï radiation.ï 
ConvectionFire spread by convection is the most dangerous and causes the largest number of injuries and deaths. When fires start in enclosed spaces such as buildings,the smoke rising from the fire gets trapped by the ceiling and then spreads in all directions to form an ever-deepening layer over the entire room space. The smoke will pass through any holes or gaps inthe walls, ceiling and floor into other parts of the building. The heat from the fire gets trapped in the building and the temperature rises.ConductionSome materials, such as metal shutters and ducting, can absorb heat and transmit it to the next room, where it can set fire to combustible items that are in contact with the heated material.
RadiationRadiation heats the air in the same way as an electric bar heater heats a room. Any material close to a fire will absorb the heat until the item starts to smoulder and then burn.
Figure 5: Smoke moving through a building
Smoke produced by a fire also contains toxic gases which are harmful to people. A fire in a building with modern fittings and materials generates smoke that is thick and black, obscures vision, causes great difficulty in breathing and can block the escape routes.It is essential that the means of escape and other fire precautions are adequate to ensure that everyone can make their escape to a place of total safety before the fire and its effects can trap them in the building.In evaluating this risk to people you will need to consider situations such as:ï fire starting on a lower floor affecting the only escape route for people on upper floors or the only escape route for people with disabilities;ï fire developing in an unoccupied space that people have to pass by to escape from the building;ï fire or smoke spreading through a building via routes such as vertical shafts, service ducts, ventilation systems, poorly installed, poorly maintained or damaged walls, partitions and ceilings affecting people in remote areas;ï fire starting in a service room and affecting hazardous materials;ï fire spreading rapidly through the building because of combustible structural elements and/or large quantities of combustible goods;16	• rapid vertical fire spread in racked displays;
ï fire and smoke spreading through a building due to poor installation of fire precautions, e.g. incorrectly installed fire doors (see Appendix B2 for more information on fire doors) or incorrectly installed services penetrating fire walls; andï fire and smoke spreading through the building due to poorly maintained and damaged fire doors or fire doors being wedged open.Further guidance on fire risks is given in Part 2, Section 1.3.3 Remove or reduce the hazardsHaving identified the fire hazards in Step 1, you now need to remove those hazards if reasonably practicable to do so. If you cannot remove the hazards, you need to take reasonable steps to reduce them if you can. This is an essential part of fire risk assessment and as a priority this must take place before any other actions.Ensure that any actions you take to remove or reduce fire hazards or risk are not substituted by other hazards or risks. For example, if you replace a flammable substance with a toxic or corrosive one, you must consider whether this might cause harm to people in other ways.Remove or reduce sources of ignitionThere are various ways that you can reduce the risk caused by potential sources of ignition, for example:ï Wherever possible replace a potential ignition source by a safer alternative.ï Replace naked flame and radiant heaters with fixed convector heaters or a central heating system. Restrict the movement of and guard portable heating appliances.ï Seperate ignition hazards and combustibles e.g. ensure sufficient clear space between lights and combustibles.ï Operate a safe smoking policy in designated smoking areas and prohibit smoking elsewhere.ï Ensure electrical and mechanical and gas equipment is installed, used, maintained and protected in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.ï Check all areas where hot work (e.g. welding) has been carried out to ensure that no ignition has taken place or any smouldering materials remain that may cause of fire.ï Ensure that no-one carrying out work on gas fittings which involves exposing pipes that contain or have contained flammable gas uses any source of ignition such as blow-lamps or hot-air guns.ï Take precautions to avoid arson.Remove or reduce sources of fuelThere are various ways that you can reduce the risks caused by materials and substances which burn, for example:ï Reduce stocks of flammable materials, liquids and gases on display in public areas to a minimum. Keep remaining stock in dedicated storerooms or storage areas where the public are not allowed to go, and keep the minimum required for the operation of the business.ï 
ï Ensure flammable materials, liquids and gases, are kept to a minimum, and are stored properly with adequate separation distances between them.ï Keep areas containing flammable gasses ventilated.ï Do not keep flammable solids, liquids and gases together.ï Remove, or treat large areas of highly combustible wall and ceiling linings, e.g. polystyrene or carpet tiles, to reduce the rate of flame spread across the surface.ï Develop a formal system for the control of combustible waste by ensuring that waste materials and rubbish are not allowed to build up and are carefully stored until properly disposed of, particularly at the end of the day.ï Take action to avoid storage areas being vulnerable to arson or vandalism.ï 
ï Check all areas where hot work(e.g. welding) has been carried out to ensure that no ignition has taken
Figure 6: Storage of flammables
  place and no smouldering or hot materials remain that may cause a fire later. Further guidance on removing and reducing hazards is given in Part 2, Section 1.Remove or reduce sources of oxygenYou can reduce the potential source of oxygen supplied to a fire by:ï closing all doors, windows and other openings not required for ventilation, particularly out of working hours;ï shutting down ventilation systems which are not essential to the function of the premises;ï not storing oxidising materials near or with any heat source or flammable materials; andï controlling the use and storage of oxygen cylinders, ensuring that they are not leaking, are not used to ‘sweeten’ the atmosphere, and that where they are located is adequately ventilated.ï 
3.4 Remove or reduce the risks to peopleHaving evaluated and addressed the risk of fire occuring and the risk to people (preventative measures) it is unlikely that you will be able to conclude that no risk remains of fire starting and presenting a risk to people in your premises.You now need to reduce any remaining fire risk to people to as low as reasonably practicable, by ensuring that adequate fire precautions are in place to warn people in the event of a fire and allow them to safely escape.The rest of this step describes the fire protection measures you may wish to adopt to reduce the remaining fire risk to people (see Steps 3.4.1 to 3.4.6).The level of fire protection you need to provide will depend on the level of risk that remains in the premises after you have removed or reduced the hazards andrisks. Part 2, Section 4.1 can help you decide the level of risk that you may still have.Flexibility of fire protection measuresFlexibility will be required when applying this guidance, the level of fire protection should be proportional to the risk posed to the safety of the people in the premises. Therefore, the objective should be to reduce the remaining risk to a level as low as reasonably practicable. The higher the risk of fire and risk to life, the higher the standards of fire protection will need to be.Your premises may not exactly fit the solutions suggested in this guide and they may need to be applied in a flexible manner without compromising the safety of the occupants.For example, if the travel distance is in excess of the norm for the level of riskyou have determined, (see Part 2, Table 2 on page 68), it may be necessary to do any one or a combination of the following to compensate:ï Provide earlier warning of fire using automatic fire detection.ï Revise the layout to reduce travel distances.ï Reduce the fire risk by removing or reducing combustible materials and/or ignition sources.ï Control the number of people in the premises.ï Limit the area to trained staff only (no public).ï Increase staff training and awareness.Note: The above list is not exhaustive and is only used to illustrate some examples of trade-offs to provide safe premises.If you decide to significantly vary away from the benchmarks in this guidance then you should seek expert advice before doing so.
3.4.1 Fire-detection and warning systemsIn some small, open-plan, single-storey offices and shops, a fire may be obvious to everyone as soon as it starts. In these cases, where the number and position of exits and the travel distance to them is adequate, a simple shout of ‘fire’ or a simple manually operated device, such as a gong or air horn that can be heard byeverybody when operated from any single point within the building, may be all that is needed. Where a simple shout or manually operated device is not adequate, it is likely that an electrical fire warning system will be required.
In larger premises, particularly those with more than one floor, where an alarm given from any single pointis unlikely to be heard throughout the building an electrical system incorporating sounders and manually operated call points (break-glass boxes) is likely to be required.This type of system is likely to be acceptable where all parts of the building are occupied at the same time and it is unlikely that a firecould start without somebody noticing it quickly.
Figure 7: Fire detection and warning system
However, where there are unoccupied areas, or common corridors and circulation spaces in multi-occupied premises, in which a fire could develop to the extent that escape routes could be affected before the fire is discovered, an automatic fire detection system may be necessary.You may need to consider special arrangements for times when people are working alone, are disabled, or when your normal occupancy patterns are different,e.g. when maintenance staff or other contractors are working at the weekend.In large or complex premises, particularly those accommodating large numbers of people, such as department stores and multi-storey office blocks, it is likely that a more sophisticated form of warning and evacuation, possibly phased, should be provided.False alarms from electrical fire warning systems are a major problem (e.g. malicious activation of manual call points) and result in many unwanted calls to the fire and rescue service every year. To help reduce the number of false alarms, the design and location of activation devices should be reviewed against the way the premises are currently used.If you are not sure whether your current arrangements are adequate, see the additional guidance on fire warning systems in Part 2, Section 2.
3.4.2 Firefighting equipment and facilitiesFirefighting equipment can reduce the risk of a small fire, e.g. a fire in a waste-paper bin, developing into a large one. The safe use of an appropriate fire extinguisher to control a fire in its early stages can also significantly reduce the risk to other people in the premises by allowing people to assist others who are at risk.This equipment will usually comprise enough portable extinguishers that must be suitable for the risk.Main types of portable extinguishers, their uses and colour codingWATERFor wood, paper, textile and solid material firesPOWDERFor liquid and electrical firesFOAMFor use on liquid firesCARBON DIOXIDE (CO2 )For liquid and electrical firesDO NOT USE on liquid, electrical or metal firesDO NOT USEon metal firesDO NOT USE onelectrical or metal firesDO NOT USE onmetal firesThe contents of an extinguisher is indicated by a zone of colour on the red body.Halon extinguishers are not shown since no new Halon production is permitted in the UKFigure 8: Types of fire extinguishersIn small premises, having one or two portable extinguishers of the appropriate type, readily available for use, may be all that is necessary. In larger, more complex premises, a number of portable extinguishers may be required and they should be sited in suitable locations, e.g. on the escape routes at each floor level. It may also be necessary to indicate the location of extinguishers by suitable signs.
Some premises will also have permanently installed firefighting equipment such as hose reels for use by trained staff or firefighters.People with no training should not be expected to attempt to extinguish a fire. However, all staff should be familiar with the location and basic operating procedures for the equipment provided, in case they need to use it. If your fire strategy means that certain people, e.g. fire marshals, will be expected to take a more active role, then they should be provided with more comprehensive training.Other fixed installations and facilities to assist firefighters, such as dry rising mains and access for fire engines, or automatically operated, fixed fire suppression systems such as sprinklers and gas or foam flooding systems may also have been provided.Where these have been required by law, e.g. the Building Regulations or local Acts, such equipment and facilities must be maintained.Similarly, if provided for other reasons, e.g. insurance, it is good practice to ensure that they are properly maintained.In most cases it will be necessary to consult a competent service engineer. Keeping records of the maintenance carried out will help you demonstrate to the enforcing authority that you have complied with fire safety law.Appendix A.1 provides a sample fire safety maintenance checklist you can use.For further guidance on portable fire extinguishers see Part 2, Section 3.1, for fixed firefighting installations, Part 2, Section 3.2 and other facilities (including those for firefighters) see Part 2, Section 3.3.
3.4.3 Escape routesOnce a fire has started, been detected and a warning given, everyone in your premises should be able to escape to a place of total safety unaided and without the help of the fire and rescue service. However, some people with disabilities and others with special needs may need from staff who will need to be designated for the purpose.Escape routes should be designed to ensure, as far as possible, that any person confronted by fire anywhere in the building, should be able to turn away from it and escape to a place of reasonable safety, e.g. a protected stairway. From there they will be able to go directly to a place of total safety away from the building.In offices those who require special assistance (e.g. very young children in a creche and some people with disabilities) could be accommodated on the same level as the final exit from the premises to facilitate escape. Where they need assistanceto evacuate, you should make sure that there are sufficient staff to ensure a speedy evacuation.The level of fire protection that should be given to escape routes will vary depending on the level of risk of fire within the premises and other related factors. Generally, premises that are simple, consisting of a single storey, will require fairly simple measures to protect the escape routes, compared to a large multi-storey building, which would require a more complex and inter-related system of fire precautions.When determining whether your premises have adequate escape routes, you need to consider a number of factors, including:ï the type and number of people using the premises;ï escape time;ï the age and construction of the premises;ï the number and complexity of escape routes and exits;ï whether lifts can or need to be used;ï the use of phased or delayed alarm evacuation; andï assisted means of escape/personal evacuation plans (PEEPS).The type and number of people using the premisesThe people present in your premises will sometimes just be employees, but most of the time will be a mixture of employees and members of the public. Employees can reasonably be expected to have an understanding of the layout of the premises, while members of the public will be unlikely to have knowledge of alternative escape routes.The number and capability of people present will influence your assessment of the escape routes. You must ensure that your existing escape routes are sufficient and capable of safely evacuating all the people likely to use your premises at any time, including events such as sales. If necessary you may need either to increase the capacity of the escape routes or restrict the number of people in the premises.
Escape timeIn the event of a fire, it is important to evacuate people as quickly as possible from the premises. Escape routes in a building should be designed so that people can escape quickly enough to ensure they are not placed in any danger from fire. The time available will depend on a number of factors, including how quickly the fire is detected and the alarm raised, the number of escape routes available, the nature of the occupants and the speed of fire growth. For simplicity the travel distances in Part 2, Table 2 on page 68 takes these factors into account. Part 2, Section 4.1 will help you decide the level of risk in your premises for escape purposes.The age and construction of the premisesOlder buildings may comprise different construction materials from newer buildings, and may be in a poorer state of repair. The materials from which your premises are constructed and the quality of building work and state of repair could contribute to the speed with which any fire may spread, and potentially affect the escape routes the occupants will need to use. A fire starting in a building constructed mainly from combustible material will spread faster than one where fire-resisting construction materials have been used.If you wish to construct internal partitions or walls in your premises, perhaps to create a sales area or to divide up an office area, you should ensure that any new partition or wall does not obstruct any escape routes or fire exits, extend travel distances or reduce the sound levels of the fire alarm system. Any walls that affect the means of escape should be constructed of appropriate material. (Further technical information is provided in Appendix B.)Depending on the findings of your fire risk assessment, it may be necessary to protect the escape routes against fire and smoke by upgrading the construction of the floors, ceiling and walls to a fire-resisting standard. You should avoid having combustible wall and ceiling linings in your escape routes. For further information see Appendix B. You may need to seek advice from a competent person. Any structural alterations may require building regulation approval.The number of escape routes and exitsIn general there should normally be at least two escape routes from all parts ofthe premises but a single escape route may be acceptable in some circumstances (e.g. part of your premises accommodating less than 60 people or where travel distances are limited).Where two escape routes are necessary and to further minimise the risk of people becoming trapped, you should ensure that the escape routes are completely independent of each other. This will prevent a fire affecting more than one escape route at the same time.When evaluating escape routes, you may need to build in a safety factor by discounting the largest exit from your escape plan, then determine whether the remaining escape routes from a room, floor or building will be sufficient to evacuate all the occupants within a reasonable time. Escape routes that provide escape in a single direction only may need additional fire precautions to be regarded as adequate.
Exit doors on escape routes and final exit doors should normally open in the direction of travel, and be quickly and easily openable without the need for a key. Checks should be made to ensure final exits are wide enough to accommodate the number of people who may use the escape routes they serve.Management of escape routesIt is essential that escape routes, and the means provided to ensure they are used safely, are managed and maintained to ensure that they remain usable and available at all times when the premises are occupied. Inform staff in training sessions about the escape routes within the premises.
Corridors and stairways that form part of escape routes should be kept clear and hazard free at all times. Items that may be a source of fuel or pose an ignition risk should not normally be located on any corridor or stairway that will be used as an escape route. Further guidance is available in Part 2, Section 4.
            Figure 9: A blocked corridor with incorrect signage            
Emergency evacuation of persons with mobility impairmentThe means of escape you provide must be suitable for the evacuation of everyove likely to be in your premises. This may require additional planning and allocation of staff roles – with appropriate training. Provsions for the emergency evacuation of disabled persons may include:ï stairways;ï evacuation lifts;ï firefighting lifts;ï horizontal evacuation;ï refuges; andï ramps.Use of these facilities will need to be linked to effective management arrangements as part of your emergency plan. The plan should not rely on fire and rescue service involvement for it to be effective.Further guidance on escape routes is given in Part 2, Section 4.
Checklistï Is your building constructed, particularly in the case of multi-storey buildings, so that, if there is a fire, heat and smoke will not spread uncontrolled through the building to the extent that that people are unable to use the escape routes?	ï Are any holes or gaps in walls, ceilings and floors properly sealed, e.g. where services such as ventilation ducts and electrical cables pass through them?	ï Can all the occupants escape to a place of total safety in a reasonable time?	ï Are the existing escape routes adequate for the numbers and type of people that may need to use them, e.g. staff, members of the public, young children, and disabled people?ï Are the exits in the right place and do the escape routes lead as directly as possible to a place of total safety?ï If there is a fire, could all available exits be affected or will at least one route from any part of the premises remain available?ï Are the escape routes and final exits kept clear at all times?ï Do the doors on escape routes open in the direction of escape?ï Can all final exit doors be opened easily and immediately if there is an emergency? ï Will everybody be able to safely use the escape routes from your premises?	ï Are the people who work in the building aware of the importance of maintaining the safety of the escape routes, e.g. by ensuring that fire doors are not wedged open and that combustible materials are not stored within escape routes?ï Are there any particular or unusual issues to consider?3.4.4 Emergency escape lightingPeople in your premises must be able to find their way to a place of total safety if there is a fire by using escape routes that have enough lighting. Where anyescape routes are internal and without windows, or your premises are used during periods of darkness, including early darkness on winter days, then some form of backup to the normal escape route lighting (emergency escape lighting) is likely to be required.In small premises, where the escape routes are simple and straightforward, borrowed lighting, e.g. from street lamps where they illuminate escape routes, may be acceptable. Where borrowed lighting is not available, suitably placed torches may be acceptable for use by trained staff.In larger, more complex premises it is likely that a more comprehensive system of electrical automatic emergency escape lighting will be needed to illuminate all the escape routes.
Where people have difficulty seeing conventional signs, a ‘way-guidance’ system may need to be considered.Further guidance on emergency escape lighting is given in Part 2, Section 5.3.4.5 Signs and noticesSignsSigns must be used, where necessary, to help people identify escape routes, find firefighting equipment and emergency fire telephones. These signs are required under the Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 19965,6 and must comply with the provisions of those Regulations.A fire risk assessment that determines that no escape signs are required (because, for example, trained staff will always be available to help members of the publicto escape routes), is unlikely to be acceptable to an enforcing authority other than in the smallest and simplest of premises where the exits are in regular use and familiar to employees and visitors.For a sign to comply with these Regulations it must be in pictogram form (see Figure 10). The pictogram can be supplemented by text if this is considered necessary to make the sign more easily understood, but you must not have a safety sign that uses only text.Where the locations of escape routes and firefighting equipment are readily apparent and the firefighting equipment is visible at all times, then signs are not necessary. In all other situations it is likely that the fire risk assessment will indicate that signs will be necessary.Figure 10: Typical fire exit sign
NoticesNotices must be used, where necessary, to provide the following:ï instructions on how to use any fire safety equipment;ï the actions to be taken in the event of fire; andï help for the fire and rescue service (e.g. location of sprinkler valves or electrical cut-off switches).
All signs and notices should be positioned so that they can be easily seen and understood.
Figure 11: Simple fire action notice
Further guidance on signs and notices is given in Part 2, Section 6.3.4.6 Installation, testing and maintenanceNew fire precautions should be installed by a competent person.You must keep any existing equipment, devices or facilities that are provided in your premises for the safety of people, such as fire alarms, fire extinguishers, lighting, signs, fire exits and fire doors, in effective working order and maintain fire separating elements and the prevention of smoke into escape routes.You must ensure regular checks, periodic servicing and maintenance are carried out whatever the size of your premises and any defects are put right as quickly as possible.You, or a person you have nominated, can carry out certain checks and routine maintenance work. Further maintenance may need to be carried out by a competent service engineer. Where contractors are used, third party certification is one method where a reasonable assurance of quality of work and competence can be achieved (see Part 2, Section 8).
The following are examples of checks and tests that should be carried out. The examples of testing and maintenance given are not intended to be prescriptive and other testing regimes may be appropriate.Daily checksRemove bolts, padlocks and security devices from fire exits, ensure that doors on escape routes swing freely and close fully and check escape routes to ensure they are clear from obstructions and combustible materials. Check the fire alarm panel to ensure the system is active and fully operational. Where practicable,visually check that emergency lighting units are in good repair and working. Check that all safety signs and notices are legible. (See Appendix B3 for more details on bolts, padlocks and security devices.)Weekly tests and checksTest fire-detection and warning systems and manually-operated warning devices weekly following the manufacturer’s or installer’s instructions. Check the batteries of safety torches and that fire extinguishers and hose reels are correctly located and in apparent working order. Fire pumps and standby diesel engines should be tested for 30 minutes each week.Monthly tests and checksTest all emergency lighting systems and safety torches to make sure they have enough charge and illumination according to the manufacturer’s or supplier’s instructions. This should be at an appropriate time when, following the test, they will not be immediately required.Check that fire doors are in good working order and closing correctly and that the frames and seals are intact.Six-monthly tests and checksA competent person should test and maintain the fire-detection and warning system.Annual tests and checksThe emergency lighting and all firefighting equipment, fire alarms and other installed systems should be tested and maintained by a competent person.All structural fire protection and elements of fire compartmentation should be inspected and any remedial action carried out. Specific guidance on the maintenance of timber fire-resisting doors is given in Appendix B2.Further guidance on maintenance and testing on individual types of equipment and facilities can be found in the relevant Section in Part 2.Appendix A.1 provides an example of a fire safety maintenance checklist. You will find it of benefit to keep a log book of all maintenance and testing.
Step 3 ChecklistEvaluate, remove, reduce and protect from risks by:ï Evaluating the risk to people in your building if a fire startsï Removing or reducing the hazards that might cause a fire Have you:ñ Removed or reduced sources of ignition?ñ Removed or reduced sources of fuel?ñ Removed or reduced sources of air or oxygen?Have you removed or reduced the risks to people if a fire occurs by:ñ Considering the need for fire detection and for warning?ñ Considering the need for firefighting equipment?ñ Determining whether your escape routes are adequate?ñ Determining whether your lighting and emergency lighting are adequate?ñ Checking that you have adequate signs and notices?ñ Regularly testing and maintaining safety equipment?ñ Considering whether you need any other equipment or facilities?In Step 4 there are four further elements of the risk assessment you should focus on to address the management of fire safety in your premises. In smaller premises this could be done as part of the day-to-day management, however, as the premises or the organisation get larger it may be necessary for a formal structure and written policy to be developed. Further guidance on managing fire safety is given in Part 2, Section 7 on page 39.
4.1 Record the significant findings and action takenIf you or your organisation employ five or more people, your premises are licensed, or an alterations notice requiring you to do so is in force, you must record the significant findings of your fire risk assessment and the actions you have taken.Significant findings should include details of:ï The fire hazards you have identified (you don’t need to include trivial things like a small tin of solvent based glue).ï The actions you have taken or will take to remove or reduce the chance of a fire occurring (preventive measures).ï Persons who may be at risk, particularly those at greatest risk.ï The actions you have taken or will take to reduce the risk to people from the spread of fire and smoke (protective measures).ï The actions people need to take in case of fire including details of any persons nominated to carry out a particular function (your emergency plan).ï The information, instruction and training you have identified that people need and how it will be given.You may also wish to record discussions you have had with staff or staff representatives (including trade unions).Even where you are not required to record the significant findings, it is good practice to do so.In some very small offices and shops, record keeping may be no more than a few sheets of paper (possibly forming part of a health and safety folder), containing details of significant findings, any action taken and a copy of the emergency plan.The record could take the form of a simple list which may be supported by a simple plan of the premises (see Figure 12).In more complex premises, it is best to keep a dedicated record including details of significant findings, any action taken, a copy of the emergency plan, maintenance of fire-protection equipment and training. There is no one ‘correct’ format specified for this. Further guidance is given in Part 2, Section 7.1.You must be able to satisfy the enforcing authority, if called upon to do so, that you have carried out a suitable and sufficient fire risk assessment. Keeping records will help you do this and will also form the basis of your subsequent reviews.If you keep records, you do not need to record all the details, only those that are significant and the action you have taken.It can be helpful to include a simple line drawing to illustrate your fire precautions (Figure 12). This can also help you check your precautions as part of your ongoing review.
Figure 12: Example of a line drawing showing general fire safety precautionsThe findings of your fire risk assessment will help you to develop your emergency plan, the instruction, information and training you need to provide, the co-operation and co-ordination arrangements you may need to have with other responsible people and the arrangements for maintenance and testing of the fire precautions.If you are required to record the significant findings of your fire risk assessment then these arrangements must also be recorded.Further guidance about fire safety records with an example is given in Part 2, Section 7.1.4.2 Emergency plansYou need to have an emergency plan for dealing with any fire situation.The purpose of an emergency plan is to ensure that the people in your premises know what to do if there is a fire and that the premises can be safely evacuated.If you or your organisation employ five or more people, or your premises are licensed or an alterations notice requiring it is in force, then details of your emergency plan must be recorded. Even if it is not required, it is good practice to keep a record.Your emergency plan should be based on the outcome of your fire risk assessment and be available for your employees, their representatives (where appointed) and the enforcing authority.In small offices and shops the emergency plan may be no more than a fire action notice.In multi-occupied, larger and more complex offices and shops, the emergency plan will need to be more detailed and compiled only after consultation with other32	occupiers and other responsible people, e.g. owners, who have control over the
building. In most cases this means that a single emergency plan covering the whole building will be necessary. It will help if you can agree on one person to co-ordinate this task.Further guidance on emergency plans is given in Part 2, Section 7.2.4.3 Inform, instruct, co-operate and co-ordinateYou must give clear and relevant information and appropriate instructions to your staff and the employers of other people working in your premises, such as contractors, about how to prevent fires and what they should do if there is a fire.Any other relevant persons should be given information about the fire safety arrangements as soon as possible.If you intend to employ a child, you must inform the parents of the significant risks you have identified and the precautions you have taken. You must also co-operate and co-ordinate with other responsible people who use any part of the premises. It is unlikely that your emergency plan will work without this.Information and instructionAll staff should be given information and instruction as soon as possible after they are appointed and regularly after that. Make sure you include staff who work outside normal working hours, such as contract cleaners or maintenance staff.The information and instructions you give must be in a form that can be used and understood. They should take account of those with disabilities such as hearing or sight impairment, those with learning difficulties and those who do not use English as their first language.The information and instruction you give should be based on your emergency plan and must include:ï the significant findings from your fire risk assessment;ï the measures that you have put in place to reduce the risk;ï what staff should do if there is a fire;ï the identity of people you have nominated with responsibilities for fire safety; andï any special arrangements for serious and imminent danger to persons from fire.ï 
In small premises, where no significant risks have been identified and there are limited numbers of staff, information and instruction may simply involve an explanation of the fire procedures and how they are to be applied. This should include showing staff the fire-protection arrangements, including the designated escape routes, the location and operation of the fire-warning system and any other fire-safety equipment provided, such as fire extinguishers. Fire action notices can complement this information and, where used, should be posted in prominent locations.In larger premises, particularly those in multi-occupied buildings, you should ensure that written instructions are given to people who have been nominated to carry out a designated safety task, such as calling the fire and rescue service or checking that exit doors are available for use at the start of each working day.Further guidance on information and instruction to staff, and on working with dangerous substances is given in Part 2, Section 7.3.Co-operation and co-ordinationIn premises that are not multi-occupied you are likely to be solely responsible. However, in buildings owned by someone else, or where there is more than one occupier, and others are responsible for different parts of the building, it is important that you liaise with them and inform them of any significant risks that you have identified. By liaising you can co-ordinate your resources to ensure that your actions and working practices do not place others at risk if there is a fire, and a co-ordinated emergency plan operates effectively.Where two or more responsible persons share premises in which an explosive atmosphere may occur, the responsible person with overall responsibility for the premises must co-ordinate any measures necessary to protect everyone from any risk that may arise. Employees also have a responsibility to co-operate with their employer so far as it is necessary to help the employer comply with any legal duty.Further information on co-operation and co-ordination is given in Part 2, Section 7.3.
4.4 Fire safety trainingYou must provide adequate fire safety training for your staff. The type of training should be based on the particular features of your premises and should:ï take account of the findings of the fire risk assessment;ï explain your emergency procedures;ï take account of the work activity and explain the duties and responsibilities of staff;ï take place during normal working hours and be repeated periodically where appropriate;ï be easily understandable by your staff and other people who may be present; andï be tested by fire drills.In small premises this may be no more than showing new staff the fire exits and giving basic training on what to do if there is a fire. In larger premises, such as a supermarket with a high staff turnover and many shift patterns, the organisation of fire safety training will need to be planned.Your staff training should include the following:ï what to do on discovering a fire;ï how to raise the alarm and what happens then;ï what to do upon hearing the fire alarm;ï the procedures for alerting members of the public and visitors including, where appropriate, directing them to exits;ï the arrangements for calling the fire and rescue service;ï the evacuation procedures for everyone in your office or shop to reach an assembly point at a place of total safety;ï the location and, when appropriate, the use of firefighting equipment;ï the location of escape routes, especially those not in regular use;ï how to open all emergency exit doors;ï the importance of keeping fire doors closed to prevent the spread of fire, heat and smoke;ï where appropriate, how to stop machines and processes and isolate power supplies in the event of a fire;ï the reason for not using lifts (except those specifically installed or nominated, following a suitable fire risk assessment, for the evacuation of people with a disability);ï the safe use of and risks from storing or working with highly flammable and explosive substances; andï the importance of general fire safety, which includes good housekeeping.ï 
All the staff identified in your emergency plan that have a supervisory roleif there is a fire (e.g. heads of department, fire marshals or wardens and, in larger offices and shops, fire parties or teams), should be given details of your fire risk assessment and receive additional training.Further guidance on training and how to carry out a fire drill is given in Part 2, Section 7.4.You should constantly monitor what you are doing to implement the fire risk assessment to assess how effectively the risk is being controlled.If you have any reason to suspect that your fire risk assessment is no longer valid or there has been a significant change in your premises that has affected your fire precautions, you will need to review your assessment and if necessary revise it.Reasons for review could include:ï changes to work processes or the way that you organise them, including the introduction of new equipment;ï alterations to the building, including the internal layout;ï substantial changes to furniture and fixings;ï the introduction, change of use or increase in the storage of hazardous substances;ï the failure of fire precautions, e.g. fire-detection systems and alarm systems, life safety sprinklers or ventilation systems;ï significant changes to displays or quantities of stock;ï a significant increase in the number of people present; andï the presence of people with some form of disability.You should consider the potential risk of any significant change before it is introduced. It is usually more effective to minimise a risk by, for example, ensuring adequate, appropriate storage space for an item before introducing it to your premises.
Do not amend your assessment for every trivial change, but if a change introduces new hazards you should consider them and, if significant, do whatever you need to do to keep the risks under control. In any case you should keep your assessment under review to make sure that the precautions are still working effectively. You may want to re-examine the fire prevention and protection measures at the same time as your health and safety assessment.If a fire or ‘near miss’ occurs, this could indicate that your existing assessment may be inadequate and you should carry out a re-assessment. It is good practice to identify the cause of any incident and then review and, if necessary, revise your fire risk assessment in the light of this.Records of testing, maintenance and training etc. are useful aids in a review process. See Appendix A.1 for an example.Alterations noticesIf you have been served with an ‘alterations notice’ check it to see whether you need to notify the enforcing authority about any changes you propose to make as a result of your review. If these changes include building work, you should also consult a building control body.You should now have completed the five-step fire risk assessment process, using the additional information in Part 2 where necessary. In any review you may need to revisit Steps 1 to 4.

Part 2 Further guidance on fire risk assessment and fire precautions
Managing fire safetyGood management of fire safety in your premises is essential to ensure that any fire safety matters that arise are always effectively addressed. In small premises this can be achieved by the manager or owner responsible for maintaining and planning fire safety in conjunction with general health and safety.In larger premises, it is good practice for a senior manager to have overall responsibility for fire safety. It may be appropriate for this responsibility to be placed with the person designated with overall responsibility for health and safety.An organisation’s fire safety policy should be flexible enough to allow modification. It should be recognised that fire safety operates at all levels within an organisation and therefore those responsible for fire safety should be able to develop, where necessary, a local action plan for their premises.The organisation’s policy should be set out in writing and may cover such things as:ï who will hold the responsibility for fire safety at board level;ï who will be the responsible person for each of their premises (this will be the person who has overall control usually the manager);ï the arrangement whereby those responsible for fire safety will, where necessary, nominate in writing specific people to carry out particular tasks if there is a fire; andï arrangements to monitor and check that individual persons responsible for fire safety are meeting the requirements of the fire safety law.
You should have a plan of action to bring together all the features you have evaluated and noted from your fire risk assessment so that you can logically plan what needs to be done. It should not be confused with the emergency plan, which is a statement of what you will do if there is a fire.The plan of action should include what you intend to do to reduce the hazards and risks you have identified and to implement the necessary protection measures.You will need to prioritise these actions to ensure that any findings which identify people in immediate danger are dealt with straight away,e.g. unlocking fire exits. In other cases where people are not in immediate danger but action is still necessary, it may be acceptable to plan this over a period of time.Before admitting the public to your premises you need to ensure that all of your fire safety provisions are in place and in working order, or, if not, that alternative arrangements are in place. Constant checks are needed while the public are present, and again after they have left. Detailed recommendations are given in BS 5588-12.52The guidance in Part 2 provides additional information to:ï ensure good fire safety management by helping you establish your fire prevention measures, fire precautions and fire safety procedures (systems equipment and plans); andï assist you to carry out your fire safety risk assessment and identify any issues that need attention.ï 
Section 1 Further guidance on fire risks and preventative measures
This section provides further information on evaluating the risk of a fire and its prevention in your premises. You should spend time developing long-term workable and effective strategies to reduce hazards and the risk of a fire starting. At its simplest this means separating flammable materials from ignition sources.You should consider:ï housekeeping;ï storage;ï dangerous substances storage, display and use;ï equipment and machinery;ï electrical safety;ï smoking;ï managing building work and alterations;ï existing layout and construction;ï particular hazards in corridors and stairways used as escape routes;ï insulated core panels;ï restricting the spread of fire and smoke;ï fire-resisting structures;ï arson; andï help for people with special needs.1.1 HousekeepingGood housekeeping will lower the chances of a fire starting, so the accumulation of combustible materials in all premises should be monitored carefully. Good housekeeping is essential to reduce the chances of escape routes and fire doors being blocked or obstructed.Keep waste material in suitable containers before it is removed from the premises. If bins, particularly wheeled bins, are used outside, secure them in a compound to prevent them being moved to a position next to the building and set on fire. Never place skips against a building (Figure 13) – they should normallybe a minimum of 6m away from any part of40	the premises.
If you generate a considerable quantity of combustible waste material then you may need to develop a formal plan to manage this effectively.In higher risk areas you need to make sure arrangements are in place for close down,e.g. checking all appliances are turned off and combustible waste has been removed.Figure 13: Bins under stairway (courtesy of Cheshire fire and rescue service)1.2 StorageMany of the materials found in your premises will be combustible. If your premises have inadequate or poorly managed storage areas then the risk of fire is likely to be increased (Figure 14). The more combustible materials you store the greater the source of fuel for a fire. Poorly arranged storage could prevent equipment such as sprinklers working effectively.Combustible materials are not just those generally regarded as highly combustible, such as polystyrene, but all materials that will readily catch fire. However, by carefully considering the type of material, the quantities kept and the storage arrangements, the risks can be significantly reduced.

Figure 14: An example of poor storageIn offices, the retention of large quantities of paper records, especially if not filed away in proprietary cabinets, can increase the fire hazard. Such readily available flammable material makes the potential effect of arson more serious.Many shops will take great care to present an efficient and attractive image in the retail area, while other areas are neglected and allowed to become over-stocked or dumping areas for unsold material.To reduce the risk, store excess materials and stock in a dedicated storage area, storeroom or cupboard. Do not store excess stock in areas where the public would normally have access.Do not pile combustible material against electrical equipment or heaters, even if turned off for the summer, and do not allow smoking in areas where combustible materials are stored.
Consider how stock is displayed in shops and evaluate any additional risk of fire that it generates. For example, rugs stacked on the floor on top of each other would not present a high fire risk, but rolls of carpet storedvertically up against a wall or hung on displays present a vertical surface for fire to spread rapidly upwards. The display of large quantities of clothing on vertical hangers is also likely to increase the risk of rapid fire development.Your fire risk assessment should also consider any additional risk generated by seasonal products such as fireworks and Christmas decorations.Consider the following to reduce these risks:ï ensure storage and display areas are adequately controlled and monitored;ï use fire-resistant display materials wherever possible (suppliers should be able to provide evidence of this); andï ensure electrical lighting used as part of the display does not become a potential source of ignition.VoidsVoids (including roof voids) should not be used for the storage of combustible material. Such voids should be sealed off or kept entirely open to allow for easy access for inspection and the removal of combustible materials.Combustible waste and packagingDelivery of some goods results in large quantities of combustible waste and packaging. The sighting use and removal of these materials needs to be carefully managed to ensure that they cannot come into contact with potential ignition sources and to not cause obstructions.1.3 Dangerous substances: storage, display and useSpecific precautions are required when handling and storing dangerous substances to minimise the possibility of an incident. Your supplier should be able to provide detailed advice on safe storage and handling, however, the following principles will help you reduce the risk from fire:ï substitute highly flammable substances and materials with less flammable ones;ï reduce the quantity of dangerous substances to the smallest reasonable amount necessary for running the business or organisation;ï 
ï correctly store dangerous substances, e.g. in a fire-resisting enclosure. All flammable liquids and gases should ideally be locked away, especially when the premises are unoccupied, to reduce the chance of them being used in an arson attack; andï ensure that you and your employees are aware of the fire risk the dangerous substances present and the precautions necessary to avoid danger.Additional general fire precautions may be needed to take account of the additional risks that may be posed by the storage and use of these substances.Certain substances and materials are by their nature, highly flammable, oxidising or potentially explosive. These substances are controlled by other legislation in addition to fire safety law, in particular the Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations20027 (also see the HSE’s Approved Code of Practice and guidance8).Flammable liquidsHighly flammable liquids present a particularly high fire risk. For example, a leak from a container of flammable solvents, such as methylated spirit, will produce large quantities of heavier-than-air flammable vapours. These can travel large distances, increasing the likelihood of their reaching a source of ignition well away from the original leak, such as a basement containing heating plant and/or electrical equipment on automatic timers.The risk is reduced by ensuring the storage and use of highly flammable liquids is carefully managed, that materials contaminated with solvent are properly disposed of (Figure 15) and when not in use, they are safely stored.Up to 50 litres may be stored in a fire-resisting cabinet or bin that will contain any leaks (Figure 16).In retail premises the quantity of flammable liquids on display should be kept to the minimum to meet business needs.
Figure 15: A fire-resisting pedal bin for ragsFigure 16: A 50 litre storage bin for flammablesThere should be no potential ignition sources in areas where flammable liquids are used or stored and flammable concentrations of vapours may be present. Any electrical equipment used in these areas, including fire alarm and emergency lighting systems, needs to be suitable for use in flammable atmospheres. In such situations, it is recommended that you should seek advice from a competent person.

LPG storageWhere LPG in cylinders or cartridges is present, you need to take particular care to minimise the possibility of its involvement in a fire. The total amount of LPG for display or demonstration in retail areas should be kept to the minimum necessary to meet business needs. In no circumstances should it exceed 70kg and this should be reduced to 15kg if the retail premises are under residential accommodation or partof a multi-use building, unless the two are separated by a substantial partition that is imperforate and provides at least 60 minutes fire resistance.Locate cylinders and cartridges in a safe and secure place where they:ï cannot be interfered with;ï can be kept upright (with valve protection fitted);ï are away from sources of ignition and/or readily ignitable materials;ï are away from any corrosive, toxic or oxidant materials; and;ï are away from stairways, exit doors and places where they may obstruct the means of escape.Quantities of LPG in excess of the amounts indicated for retail areas should be stored in a properly designed and located storage area that is dedicated for LPG.
Bulk storage tanks for LPG should be designed, installed and located in accordance with industry guidance.Advice on the use of LPG for heating is given in Section 1.4.Further guidance on the safe storage of LPG is available from your supplier or the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association’s Code of Practice.9FireworksFireworks can cause fires and explosions in shops. They have the potential for a violent release of pressure and heat that can cause severe harm to people and damage to a building.Fireworks can be ignited or detonated by contact with ignition sources or by contamination, where other chemicals or water cause the material to become unstable.If you sell fireworks you have certain obligations to the public and your staff. You must:ï be ‘registered’ or obtain a licence to store fireworks;ï obtain a ‘licence to sell fireworks’ if you intend to sell outside the usual fireworks period;ï store fireworks safely;ï not sell fireworks to under 18s; andï review your risk assessment and, where necessary, take additional measures.Preventative measures include:ï store and display fireworks in appropriate containers, display cabinets;ï keep all fireworks in a dry place;ï do not store an excessive amount of fireworks either in the shop or stockroom and do not store more than your licence permits;ï do not store the fireworks near other articles that could spread the fire;ï do not store fireworks near an escape route;ï exclude sources of ignition and in particular, stop people smoking anywhere near the fireworks; andï avoid all unnecessary handling of fireworks;ï 
Further guidance on the storage and sale of fireworks is available on the DTI website www.dti.gov.uk/fireworks.AerosolsSome aerosols can contain flammable products stored at pressure and they can present a high level of hazard. When ignited they can explode, produce fireballs and rocket to distances of 40m. Their presence in premises can make it unsafe for firefighters to enter a building and they have the potential for starting multiple fires.The following should be considered to reduce these risks:ï All staff involved in the movement, storage and display of aerosol cans should be adequately instructed, trained and supervised.ï Damaged and leaking aerosol cans should be removed immediately to a safe, secure, well ventilated place prior to disposal. Powered vehicles should not be used to move damaged stock, unless specially adapted for use in flammable atmospheres. Arrangements should be made for disposal at a licenced waste management facility.1.4 Equipment and machineryCommon causes of fire in equipment are:ï allowing ventilation points to become clogged or blocked, causing overheating;ï inadequate cleaning of heat-shrink packaging equipment, such as that used in in-store bakeries;ï allowing extraction equipment in catering environments to build up excessive grease deposits;ï misuse or lack of maintenance of cooking equipment and appliances; andï disabling or interfering with automatic or manual safety features and cut-outs.All machinery, apparatus and office equipment should be properly maintained by a competent person. Appropriate signs and instructions on safe use may be necessary.
HeatingIndividual heating appliances require particular care if they are to be used safely, particularly those which are kept for emergency use during a power cut or as supplementary heating during severe weather. The greatest risks arise from lack of maintenance and staff unfamiliarity with them. Heaters should preferably be secured in position when in use and fitted with a fire guard if appropriate.As a general rule, convector or fan heaters should be preferred to radiant heaters because they present a lower risk of fire and injury.The following rules should be observed:ï All heaters should be kept well clear of combustible materials and where they do not cause an obstruction.ï Heaters which burn a fuel should be sited away from draughts.ï Portable fuel burning heaters (including bottled gas (LPG)) should only be used in exceptional circumstances and if shown to be acceptable in your risk assessment.All gas heating appliances should be used only in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions and should be serviced annually by a competent person.In general, staff should be discouraged from bringing in their own portable heaters and other electrical equipment (e.g. kettles) into the premises.Cooking processesTypical installations used in cooking processes include deep fat fryers, ovens, grills, surface cookers, ductwork, flues, filters, hoods, extract and ventilation ducts and dampers.These cooking processes can operate with high temperatures, involving large quantities of oil and combustible food stuffs. Heat sources used for cooking processes include: gas, electric and microwave. The main cause of fire are ignition of cooking oil, combustion of crumbs and sediment deposits, and ductwork fires from a build up of fats and grease.The siting of cooking processes close to insulated core panels with combustible insulation (see Section 1.10) can lead to the likely ignition of the panels and consequent rapid fire spread to other parts of the building. This practice should therefore be avoided.

The following should be considered to reduce the risk from cooking processes:ï regular cleaning to prevent build-up of crumbs and other combustible material;ï fire resisting containers for waste products;ï a fire suppression system capable of controlling an outbreak of fire;ï monitored heat/oil levels, even after the cooking process is complete and installation of temperature control/cut-off/ shut off devices as appropriate;ï duct, joints and supports able to withstand high cooking temperatures;ï seperation from wall and ceiling panels (with combustible insulation) e.g. 2.5m for walls, 4m for ceilings;ï insulation of ducts to prevent heating/ignition of nearby combustible wall and ceiling materials;ï a regular programme for inspection and cleaning;ï a programme of electrical and mechanical maintenance; andï annual service of all gas heating appliances by a competent person.1.5 Electrical safetyElectrical equipment can be a significant cause of accidental fires in shops and offices. The main causes are:ï overheating cables and equipment, e.g. due to overloading circuits, bunched or coiled cables or impaired cooling fans;ï incorrect installation or use of equipment;ï little or no maintenance and testing of equipment;ï incorrect fuse ratings;ï damaged or inadequate insulation on cables or wiring;ï combustible materials being placed too close to electrical equipment which may give off heat even when operating normally or may become hot due to a fault;ï arcing or sparking by electrical equipment; andï embrittlement and cracking of cable sheathing in cold environments.
All electrical equipment should be installed and maintained in a safe manner by a competent person. If portable electrical equipment is used, including items brought into a workplace by staff, then your fire risk assessment should ensure that it visually inspected and undergoes portable appliance testing (‘PAT’) at intervals suitable for the type of equipment and its frequency of use (refer to HSE guidance10). If you have any doubt about the safety of your electrical installation then you should consult a competent electrician.Issues to consider include:ï overloading of equipment;ï correct fuse ratings;ï PAT testing and testing of fixed installations;ï protection against overloading of installation;ï protection against short circuit;ï insulation, earthing and electrical isolation requirements;ï frequency of electrical inspection and test;ï temperature rating and mechanical strength of flexible cables;ï portable electrical equipment;ï physical environment in which the equipment is used (e.g. wet or dusty atmospheres); andï suitable use and maintenance of personal protective equipment.All electrical installations should be regularly inspected by a competent electrical engineer appointed by you, or on your behalf, in accordance with the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EAW Regulations).53 The use of low voltage equipment should conform to the requirements of the Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 1994,54 including the requirement to be CE marked.1.6 SmokingCarelessly discarded cigarettes and other smoking materials are a major cause of fire. A cigarette can smoulder for several hours, especially when surrounded by combustible material. Many fires are started several hoursafter the smoking materials have been emptied into waste bags and left for future disposal.
Consider prohibiting smoking in your premises other than in the designated smoking areas.Display suitable signs throughout the premises informing people of the smoking policy and the locations where smoking is permitted.In those areas where smoking is permitted, provide non-combustible deep and substantial ashtrays to help prevent unsuitable containers being used. Empty all ashtrays daily into a metal waste bin and take it outside. It is dangerous to empty ashtrays into plastic waste sacks which are then left inside for disposal later.1.7 Managing building work and alterationsFires are more frequent when buildings are undergoing refurbishment or alteration.You should ensure that, before any building work starts, you have reviewed the fire risk assessment and considered what additional dangers are likely to be introduced. You will need to evaluate the additional risks to people, particularly in those buildings that continue to be occupied. Lack of pre-planning can lead to haphazard co-ordination of fire safety measures.You should liaise and exchange information with contractors who will also have a duty under the Construction (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 199611, 12 to carry out a risk assessment and inform you of their significant findings and the preventive measures they may employ. This may be supported by the contractors’ agreed work method statement. The designer should also have considered fire safety as part of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 1994 (the CDM Regulations).55You should continuously monitor the impact of the building work on the general fire safety precautions, such as the increased risk from quantities of combustible materials and accumulated waste and maintaining adequate means of escape. You should only allow the minimum materials necessary for the work in hand within or adjacent to your building.Additional risks can include:ï hot work such as flame cutting, welding, soldering, or paint stripping;ï temporary electrical equipment;ï 
blocking of escape routes, including external escape routes;ï introduction of combustibles into an escape route;ï loss of normal storage facilities;ï fire safety equipment, such as automatic fire-detection systems becoming affected;ï fire-resisting partitions being breached or fire doors being wedged open (see Appendix B1 for information on fire-resisting separation); andï additional personnel who may be unfamiliar with the premises.Activities such as welding, flame cutting, use of blow lamps or portable grinding equipment can pose a serious fire hazard and need to be strictly controlled when carried out in areas near flammable materials. This can be done by having a written permit to work for the people involved (whether they are your employees or those of the contractor).12A permit to work is appropriate in situations of high hazard/risk and, for example, where there is a need to:ï ensure that there is a formal check confirming that a safe system of work is being followed;ï co-ordinate with other people or activities;ï provide time-limits when it is safe to carry out the work; andï provide specialised personal protective equipment (such as breathing apparatus) or methods of communication.You must notify the fire and rescue service about alterations in your premises if an alterations notice is in force.Further guidance on fire safety during construction work is available from the HSE56,57 and the Fire Protection Association.581.8 Existing layout and constructionIn many shops, and increasingly in offices, the design is for open-plan areas allowing customers and employees to move freely throughoutthe floor.

Traditionally, occupants are advised to shut doors when escaping from a fire but in open- plan areas there are few doors to shut. In these areas the fire, and especially the smoke, may spread faster than expected.To assess the risk in your premises you need to evaluate the construction and layout of your premises. This does not mean a structural survey, unless you suspect that the structureis damaged or any structural fire protection is missing or damaged, but rather an informed look around to see if there are any easy paths through which smoke and fire may spread and what you can do to stop that. In general, older buildings will have more void areas, possibly hidden from view, which will allow smoke and fire to spread away from its source. Whatever your type of building, you may need to consider typical situations that may assist the spread of fire and smoke such as:ï vertical shafts, e.g. lifts, open stairways, dumb waiters or holes for moving stock around;ï false ceilings, especially if they are not fire- stopped above walls;ï voids behind wall panelling;ï unsealed holes in walls and ceilings where pipe work, cables or other services have been installed; andï doors, particularly to stairways, which are ill-fitting or routinely left open.1.9 Particular hazards in corridors and stairways used as escape routesItems that are a source of fuel, pose an ignition risk, or are combustible and likely to increase the fire loading or spread of fire, should not be located on any corridor or, stairway or circulation space that will be used as an escape route.Such items include:ï portable heaters, e.g. bottled gas (LPG) or electric radiant heaters and electric convectors or boilers;ï gas cylinders for supplying heaters;ï cooking appliances; andï unenclosed gas pipes, meters, and other fittings.
However, where more than one escape route is available and depending on the findings of your risk assessment, items such as those below may be acceptable if the minimum exit widths are maintained and the item presents a relatively low fire risk:ï non-combustible lockers;ï vending machines;ï small items of electrical equipment (e.g. photocopiers); andï small coat racks and/or small quantities of upholstered furniture which meetsBS 7176 or the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988.1.10 Insulated core panelsMany buildings have insulated core panels as exterior cladding or for internal structures (Figure 17) and partitions. The food industry, in particular, uses insulated core panels because they are easy to clean and facilitate consistent temperature control within the premises. The simple construction of these panels enables alterations and for additionalinternal partitions to be erected with minimum disruption to business.Figure 17: Insulated core panels – internalThey normally consist of a central insulated core, sandwiched between an inner and outer metal skin. There is no air gap. The external surface is then normally coated with a PVC covering to improve weather resistance or the aesthetic appeal of the panel. The central core can be made of various insulating materials, ranging from virtually non-combustible through to highly combustible. Differing fire hazards are
associated with common types of insulation, when the panels are subjected to certain temperatures. Typical examples are:ï Mineral rock/modified phenolic will produce surface char and little smoke or gaseous combustion products, at temperatures above 230°C.ï Polyisocyanurate (PIR)/polyurethane (PUR) will char and will generate smoke and gaseous combustion products, at temperatures above 430°C PIR and 300°C PUR.ï Expanded polystyrene (EPS) will melt and will generate smoke and gaseous combustion products, at temperatures above 430°C PIR.Insulation charring can lead to panel delamination/ collapse, and the gaseous combustion products can fill areas with the toxic gases carbon monoxide and styrene.A number of fires in buildings where insulated panels have been used extensively in the fabric of the building have highlighted the particular dangers that may be associated with this form of construction, i.e. where the fabric of the building can contribute to the fire hazards.In a fire the following may occur:ï early buckling and falling away of the facing materials;ï burning of the combustible insulating material;ï production of large quantities of dense, toxic smoke;ï rapid heat generation;ï early loss of structural strength can result if the system has not been properly designed, and this can lead to the collapse of the wall, partition or ceiling;ï there may be cavities in older buildings where the panels are used as an internal envelope, enabling fire to spread unnoticed and possibly unchecked by fire barriers.Once installed it is difficult to identify the core material of a panel and its potential fire hazard.The following best practise can help you reduce risks associated with insulated panels.ï Do not install heating appliances, such as ovens, against the panels. Operate a clear distance policy for cooking systems.ï Control ignition sources that are adjacent to, or penetrating the panels.ï 
Control hot working.ï Check for damage to heater tapes used to prevent ice build-up at doors.ï Do not store highly combustible materials against panels or allow rubbish to collect against panels.ï Have damaged panels or sealed joints repaired immediately and make sure that jointing compounds or gaskets used around the edges of the panels are in good order.ï Check where openings have been made for doors, windows, cables and ducts to ensure that these have been effectively sealed and the inner core has not been exposed.ï Check that there has been no mechanical damage and repair any that has occured,e.g. caused by mobile equipment such as fork lift trucks.ï Ensure that any loads, such as storage and equipment, are only supported by panels which have been designed and installed to perform this function.ï Check that the inner and outer skins are adhering tightly to the core.ï Ensure that the panels are correctly secured to the structure or are designed to be independently structurally secure. One solution is to ensure the retaining brackets bolt the panel to a support frame through the outer and inner skins;ï Ensure large roof cavities are appropriately protected, e.g. escape routes are clear, signed and have limited travel distance, and fire warning systems are audible.The use of combustible panels in areas of buildings with a high life risk, e.g. where large numbers of people are present, should be carefully considered. Your fire risk assessment may need to be revised to ensure that any increased risk resulting from this type of construction is considered.The potential for fire development involving mineral fibre cores is less than that for panels containing polymeric cores. Therefore, in areas where there is considerable life risk, it may be appropriate to consider replacing combustible panels, providing a fire suppression system or installing non-combustible fire breaks within or between the panels at suitable intervals.

Insulated core panels should be installed by a competent person in accordance with industry guidance.Guidance on the design, construction, specification and fire management of insulated core panels has been published by the International Association of Cold Storage Contractors.591.11 Restricting the spread of fire and smokeTo reduce the risk to people if there is a fire, you need to consider how to control or restrict the spread of fire and smoke. The majority of people who die in fires are overcome by the smoke and gases.It is important ensure that, in the event of fire, the rate of fire growth is restricted in its early stages. It should also be noted that most measures which restrict the rate of fire growth in its early stages will also serve to restrict the fire spread in its later stages.
Display materials and decorationsDisplays are often located in corridors, entrance foyers and shop floors, and generally comprise materials such as paper, cardboard and plastic which provide a means for the rapid spread of fire. You should assess how these materials could contribute to the development of a fire in the area where they are located. To reduce the risk of fire spread, you should consider the following:ï avoid the use of displays in corridors and foyers;ï minimise the size and number of display areas to discrete, separated areas;ï treating displays with proprietary flame- retardant sprays;ï the use of display boxes;ï keep displays away from curtains, light fittings and heaters;ï keep displays away from ceiling voids which may lack fire barriers; andï ensure that there are no igntion sources in the vicinity.Staff information should be confined to appropriately located display boards in areas away from escape routes. Display boards may be used on escape routes as long as they are no bigger than 1m2 or have been enclosed in a sealed display case.Catering facilitiesWherever possible any extensive catering facilities, particularly those with deep fryers, should be located in a seperate building, or alternatively, seperated from the remainder of the building by fire doors and fire resisting construction and provided with adequate ventilation.Where flues pass through any part of the structure, the structure should be protected by fire resisting construction. Where fire shutters are used these should be capable of operating both manually and by fusible link. Where a fire detection and warning system is installed, the fire shutter should also be designed to closeon activation of the system via a controlled geared mechanism.Fire-resisting structuresMany buildings are divided into different areas by fire doors and fire-resisting walls and floors. These are partly designed to keep a fire within one area, giving people more time to escape. You will need to identify which doors, walls
and floors in your building are fire-resisting. There may be information available from when the building was built, if alterations have been made, or from a previously held fire certificate.High-risk areas should be seperated from the rest of the premises by 30-minute fire- resisting construction.Normally if there are fire doors in a wall, then the wall itself will also need to be fire-resisting. (See Appendix B1 for more information about fire-resisting walls.) If a wall or floor is required to be fire-resisting then you should not make any holes in it, e.g. for extra doors or pipe ducts, without consulting a competent person.Smoke controlIn larger buildings and some units in shopping complexes, there may be some form of automatic smoke ventilation (Figure 18) provided for the safety of the occupants and to assist firefighting (e.g. Smoke and Heat Exhaust Ventilation Systems (SHEVS)). These systems are designed to restrict the spread of fire and smoke usually by venting the heat and smoke through the
roof or via other routes to the outside. Low level inlet air is essential for the operation of SHEVS and all openings for this purpose should not be obstructed.Special down-stands may have been installed to create a reservoir which will contain the smoke and hot gases at roof level, while vents allow the smoke to escape. It is important that any smoke can flow easily into the reservoirs and that nothing which could cause an obstruction, e.g. display material, is fixed near the vents. It is important that any smoke can flow easily into the reservoirs and that nothing which could cause an obstruction, e.g. large advertising displays, is fixed near the vents.In shopping complexes the front of individual shops often forms part of the smoke control design. If your building has smoke vents fitted, or any other form of smoke control, then you may need to seek advice from someone who is competent in such systems.Further information on smoke control can be found from CIBSE Guide E64 or from the BRE.65
Figure 18: Smoke vents

1.12 ArsonRecent studies indicate that, across all premises types, over 2,100 deliberately set fires, resulting in two deaths and 55 injuries, occur every week. In shops it is estimated that 44% of all fires are deliberately set.*51 All premises can be targeted either deliberately or just because they offer easy access.Be aware of other small, deliberately set fires in the locality, which can indicate an increased risk to your premises. Be suspicious of any small ‘accidental’ fires on the premises and investigate them fully and record your findings.Fires started deliberately can be particularly dangerous because they generally develop much faster and may be intentionally started in escape routes. Of all the risk-reduction measures, the most benefit may come from efforts to reduce the threat from arson.Measures to reduce arson may include the following:ï ensure the outside of the premises is well lit and, if practical, secure the perimeter of the premises;ï thoroughly secure all entry points tothe premises, including windows and the roof, but make sure that this does not compromise people’s ability to use the escape routes;ï make sure you regularly remove all combustible rubbish;ï do not place rubbish skips adjacent to the building and secure waste bins in a compound separated from the building;ï do not park vehicles or store goods or materials in the open next to windows or doors opening into buildings;ï encourage staff to report people acting suspiciously;ï remove automatic entry rights from staff who have been dismissed;ï ensure that your security alarm/fire- detection system is monitored and acted on;ï secure flammable liquids so that intruders cannot use them;ï 
secure all storage areas and unused areas of the building that do not form part of an escape route against unauthorised access, ensure access to keys to those areas is restricted; andï fit secure metal letterboxes on the inside of letter flaps to contain any burning materials that may be pushed through.Further guidance on reducing the risk of arson has been published by the Arson Prevention Bureau.51**1.13 Help for people with special needsOf all the people who may be especially at risk you will need to pay particular attention to people who may have special needs, including those with a disability. The Disability Rights Commission estimates that 11 million peoplein this country have some form of disability, which may mean that they find it more difficult to leave a building if there is a fire. Under the Disability Discrimination Act,13 if disabled people could realistically expect to use your premises, then you must anticipate any reasonable adjustments that would make it easier for that right to be exercised.The Disability Discrimination Act13 includes the concept of ‘reasonable adjustments’ and this can be carried over into fire safety law. It can mean different things in different circumstances. For a small business, it may be considered reasonable to provide contrasting colours on a handrail to help those with vision impairment to follow an escape route more easily. However, it might be unreasonable to expect that same business to install an expensive voice-alarm system. Appropriate ‘reasonable adjustments’ for a large business or organisation may be much more significant.If disabled people are going to be in your premises then you must also provide a safe means for them to leave if there is a fire. You and your staff should be aware that disabled people may not react, or can react differently, to a fire warning or small fire. You should give similar consideration to others with special needs such as parents with young children or the elderly.

In premises with a simple layout, a common- sense approach, such as offering to help lead a blind person or helping an elderly person down steps may be enough. In more complexpremises, more elaborate plans and procedures will be needed, with trained staff assigned to specified duties. In this case you may also wish to contact a professional consultant or take advice from disability organisations.Consider the needs of those with mental disabilities or spatial recognition problems. The range of disabilities encountered can be considerable, extending from mild epilepsy to complete disorientation in an emergency situation. Many of these can be addressed byproperly trained staff, discreet and empathetic use of the ‘buddy system’ or by careful planning of colour and texture to identify escape routes.Where people with special needs use orwork in the premises, their needs should, so far as is practicable, be discussed with them. These will often be modest and may require only changes or modifications to existing procedures. You may need to develop individual ‘personal emergency evacuation plans’ (PEEPs) for disabled people who frequently use a building. They will need to be confident of any plan/PEEP that is put in place after consultation with them.As part of your consultation exercise you will need to consider the matter of personal dignity.If members of the public use your building then you may need to develop a range of standard PEEPs which can be provided on request to a disabled person or others with special needs.Guidance on removing barriers to the everyday needs of disabled people is in BS 8300.14 Much of this advice will also help disabled people during an evacuation.Further advice can be obtained from the Disability Rights Commission at www.drc-gb.org.
Section 2 Further guidance onfire detection and warning systems
Where an electrical fire-warning system is necessary then a straightforward arrangement typically includes the following:ï manual call points (break-glass call points) next to exits with at least one call point on each floor;ï electronic sirens or bells; andï a control and indicator panel.An alternative system of interconnected combined manual call points and sounders may be acceptable.If your building has areas where a fire could develop undetected or where people work alone and might not see a fire, then it may be necessary to upgrade your fire-warning system to incorporate automatic fire detection or install an automatic fire-detection and warning system.If, for any reason, your system fails you must still ensure that people in your premises can be warned and escape safely. A temporary arrangement, such as gongs, whistles or air horns, combined with suitable training, may be acceptable for a short period, pending system repairs.The fire warning sound levels should be loud enough to alert everyone, taking intoaccount background noise. In areas with high background noise, or where people may be wearing hearing protectors, the audible warning should be supplemented, e.g. with visual alarms.People with hearing difficultiesWhere people have hearing difficulties, particularly those who are profoundly deaf, then simply hearing the fire warning is likely to be the major difficulty. If these persons are never alone while on the premises then this may not be a serious problem, as it would be reasonable for other occupants to let them know that the building should be evacuated. If a person with hearing difficulties is likely to be alone, then consider other means of raising the alarm. Among the most popular are visual beacons and vibrating devices or pagers that are linked to the existing fire alarm.
Voice alarmsResearch has shown that some people and, in particular, members of the public, do not always react quickly to a conventional fire alarm. Voice alarms are therefore becoming increasingly popular and can also incorporate a public address facility. The message or messages sent must be carefully considered. It is therefore essential to ensure that voice- alarm systems are designed and installed by aperson with specialist knowledge of these systems.Schematic planIn order to quickly determine where a fire has been detected, you should consider displaying a schematic plan showing fire alarm zones in a multi-zoned system adjacent to the control panel.2.1 Manual call pointsManual call points, often known as ‘break- glass’ call points, enable a person who discovers a fire to immediately raise the alarm and warn other people in the premises of the danger.People leaving a building because of a fire will normally leave by the way they entered. Consequently, manual call points are normally positioned at exits and storey exits that people may reasonably be expected to use in case of fire, not just those designated as fire exits.However it is not necessary in every case to provide call points at every exit.Manual call points should normally be positioned so that, taking into account all fixtures and fittings, machinery and stock are in place, no one should have to travel more than 45m to the nearest alarm point. This distance may need to be less if your premises caterfor people of limited mobility or there are particularly hazardous areas. They should be conspicuous (red), fitted at a height of about1.4m (or less for premises with a significant number of wheelchair users), and not in an area likely to be obstructed.
2.2 Automatic fire detectionAutomatic fire detection may be needed for a number of reasons. These can include:ï if you have areas where people are isolated or remote and could become trapped bya fire because they are unaware of its development, such as lone workers;ï if you have areas where a fire can develop unobserved (e.g. storerooms);ï as a compensating feature, e.g. for inadequate structural fire protection, in dead-ends or where there are extended travel distances; andï where smoke control and ventilation systems are controlled by the automatic fire-detection system.If you have an automatic fire detection system, the system should:ï be designed to accommodate the emergency evacuation procedure;ï give an automatic indication of the fire warning and its location. If the indicator panel is located in a part of the premises other than the control point (for example, to the secretary’s office) there should ideally be a repeater panel sited in the control point;ï be maintained and tested by a competent person; andï communicate with a central control room (if you have one).New automatic fire detection systems should be designed and installed by a competent person. Further guidance is given in BS 5839-116 or a more recent standard where applicable.Where the public address system is part of the fire warning system it should be connected to an auxiliary power source to ensure the continued use of the system in the event of fire or other emergency.Whichever warning or detection systems are in place, however, if a fire occurs the fire and rescue service should always be called immediately.2.3 
Reducing false alarmsFalse alarms from automatic fire detection systems are a major problem and result in many unwanted calls to the fire and rescue service every year. Guidance on reducing false alarms has been published by ODPM/ CFOA/BFPSA.15If there are excessive false alarms in your premises, people may become complacent and not respond correctly to a warning of a real fire. In such circumstances, you may be failing to comply with fire safety law. All false alarms should be investigated to identify the cause of the problem and remedial action taken.To help reduce the number of false alarms, the system design and location of detection and activation devices should be reviewed against the way the premises are currently used. For example, if a store room has been converted to staff area with cooking facilities (e.g. a microwave and toaster) then the likelihood of the detector being set off is increased. Consequently, subject to the outcome of the fire risk assessment a heat detector may be more appropriate.Similarly, if a manual call point is placed in a storage area where there is continual movement of stock, the call point is likely to be accidentally damaged. In this case a simple, fabricated hinged metal guard around the call point is likely to solve the problem.Occasionally people set off a manual call point in the genuine, but incorrect belief that there is a fire. Nothing should be done to discourage such actions and the number of false alarms generated this way is not significant.Further detailed guidance on reducing false alarms is available in BS 5839-1.162.4 Staged fire alarmsIn the vast majority of premises sounding the fire warning system should trigger the immediate and total evacuation of the building. However, in some large or complex premises this may not be necessary as alternative arrangements may be in place.

These alternative arrangements broadly fall into two groups. Firstly, those people potentially most at risk from a fire, usually those closestto where the alarm was activated, will be immediately evacuated, while others in the building are given an alert signal and will only evacuate if it becomes necessary. This is generally called a phased evacuation and theinitial movement, depending on the layout and configuration of the premises, can be either horizontal or vertical.The second alternative is for the initial alert signal to be given to certain staff, who then carry out pre-arranged actions to help others to evacuate more easily. It requires able, fully- trained staff to be available at all times and should not be seen as a simple means of reducing disruption to working practices.Where staged alarms are being used, disabled people should be alerted on the first stage to give them the maximum time to escape.These arrangements both require fire-warning systems capable of giving staged alarms, including an ‘alert signal’ and a different ‘evacuate signal’ and should only be considered after consultation with specialist installers and, if necessary, the relevant enforcing authority.Such systems also require a greater degree of management input to ensure that staff and others are familiar with the system and action required.2.5 Testing and maintenanceYour fire-warning and/or detection system should be supervised by a named responsible person, given enough authority and training to manage all aspects of the routine testing and scrutiny of the system.The control and indicating equipment should be checked at least every 24 hours to ensure there are no specific faults. All types of fire- warning systems should be tested once a week. For electrical systems a manual call point should be activated (using a different call point for each successive test), usually by inserting a dedicated test key (Figure 19).This will check that the control equipment is capable of receiving a signal and in turn, activating the warning alarms. Manual call points may be numbered to ensure they are sequentially tested.
Testing and maintenance of the system should be carried out by a competent person.Figure 19: Using a test keyIt is good practice to test the alarm at the same time each week, but additional tests may be required to ensure that staff or people present outside normal working hours are given the opportunity to hear the alarm.Where systems are connected to a central monitoring station, arrangements should be made prior to testing to avoid unwanted false alarms. Further guidance on testing and maintenance of fire warning systems can be found in BS 5839-1.16Six-monthly servicing and preventive maintenance should be carried out by a competent person with specialist knowledge of fire-warning and automatic detection systems. This task is normally fulfilled by entering into a service contract with a specialist fire alarm company.It is good practice to record all tests, false alarms and any maintenance carried out.
2.6 Guaranteed power supplyIf your fire risk assessment concludes that an electrical fire-warning system is necessary, then the Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 19965 requires it to have a back-up power supply.Whatever back-up system is used, it should normally be capable of operating the fire- warning and detection system for a minimum period of 24 hours and sounding the alarm signal in all areas for 30 minutes.2.7 New and altered systemsGuidance on the design and installation of new systems and those undergoing substantial alterations is given in BS 5839.16 If you are unsure that your existing system is adequate you will need to consult a competent person.
Section 3 Further guidance on firefighting equipment and facilitiesYou have responsibility for the provision of appropriate firefighting equipment. It is also your responsibility to check that all firefighting equipment is in the correct position and in satisfactory order before the premises are used.Appropriate staff should be trained in the use of all such equipment.3.1 Portable firefighting equipmentFires are classed according to what is burning. Fire extinguishers provided should be appropriate to the classes of fire found in your premises in accordance with Table 1.Table 1: Class of fireClass of fireDescriptionClass AFires involving solid materials such as wood, paper or textiles.Class BFires involving flammable liquids such as petrol, diesel or oils.Class CFires involving gases.Class DFires involving metals.Class FFires involving cooking oils such as in deep-fat fryers.Note:1. If there is a possibility of a fire in your premises involving material in the shaded boxes then you should seek advice from a competent person.2. It is not safe to fight fires involving aerosols with fire extinguishers.1. 
Number and type of extinguishersTypically for the Class A fire risk, the provision of one water-based extinguisher for approximately every 200m2 of floor space, with a minimumof two extinguishers per floor, will normally be adequate.Where it is determined that there are additionally other classes of fire risk, the appropriate type, number and size of extinguisher should be provided. Further information is available in BS 5306-8.18Where the fire risk is not confined to a particular location, e.g. Class A fires, the fire extinguishers should be positioned on escape routes, close to the exit from the room or floor, or the final exit from the building. Similarly, where the particular fire risk is specifically located, e.g. flammable liquids, the appropriate fire extinguisher should be near to the hazard, and located so that it can be safely used. They should be placed on a dedicated stand or hung on a wall at a convenient height so that employees can easily lift them off (at about 1m for larger extinguishers, 1.5m for smaller ones, to the level of the handle). Ideally no one should have to travel more than 30m to reach a fire extinguisher. If there is a risk of malicious use you may need to use alternative, and more secure, locations.Consider the implications of the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 199217 when selecting and siting firefighting equipment.Where there are self-contained small premises, multi-purpose extinguishers which can cover a range of risks may be appropriate. Depending on the outcome of your fire risk assessment, it may be possible to reduce this to one extinguisher in very small premises with a floor space of less than 90m2.Extinguishers manufactured to current standards (BS EN 3-7)79 are predominately red but may have a colour-coded area, sited above or within the instructions, denoting the typeof extinguisher. Most older extinguishers, manufactured to previous standards, have bodies painted entirely in a single colour which denotes the type of extinguisher. These older extinguishers remain acceptable until they are no longer serviceable. However, it is good practice to ensure that old and new style extinguishers are not mixed on the same floor of a building.
The following paragraphs describe the different types of extinguisher. The colour referred to is the colour of the extinguisher or the colour- coded area.Water extinguishers (red)This type of extinguisher can only be used on Class A fires. They allow the user to direct water onto a fire from a considerable distance. A 9-litre water extinguisher can be quite heavy and some water extinguishers with additives can achieve the same rating, although they are smaller and therefore considerably lighter. This type of extinguisher is not suitable for use on live electrical equipment.Water extinguishers with additives (red) This type of extinguisher is suitable for Class A fires. They can also be suitable for use on Class B fires and where appropriate, this will be indicated on the extinguisher. They are generally more efficient than conventional water extinguishers.Foam extinguishers (cream)This type of extinguisher can be used on Class A or B fires and is particularly suited to extinguishing liquid fires such as petrol and diesel. They should not be used on free- flowing liquid fires unless the operator has been specially trained, as these have the potential to rapidly spread the fire to adjacent material. This type of extinguisher is not suitable for deep-fat fryers or chip pans.Powder extinguishers (blue)This type of extinguisher can be used onmost classes of fire and achieve a good ‘knock down’ of the fire. They can be used on fires involving electrical equipment but will almost certainly render that equipment useless.Because they do not cool the fire appreciably it can re-ignite. Powder extinguishers can create a loss of visibility and may affect people who have breathing problems, and are not generally suitable for enclosed spaces.Carbon dioxide extinguishers (black)This type of extinguisher is particularly suitable for fires involving electrical equipment as they will extinguish a fire without causing any further damage (accept in the case of some electronic equipment e.g. computers). As with all fires involving electrical equipment, the power should be disconnected if possible.

Class ‘F’ extinguishersThis type of extinguisher is particularly suitable for commercial catering establishments with deep-fat fryers.Selection, installation and maintenance of portable fire extinguishersAll portable fire extinguishers will require periodic inspection, maintenance and testing. Depending on local conditions such as the likelihood of vandalism or the environment where extinguishers are located, carry out brief checks to ensure that they remain serviceable. In normal conditions a monthly check should be enough. Maintenance by a competent person should be carried out annually.New fire extinguishers should comply with BS EN 3-7.79 Guidance on the selection and installation of fire extinguishers can be found in BS 5306-8,18 for maintenance, BS 5306-319 and for colour coding in BS 7863.20Fire blanketsFire blankets should be located in the vicinity of the fire hazard they are to be used on, but in a position that can be safely accessedin the event of a fire. They are classified as either light duty or heavy duty. Light-duty fire blankets are suitable for dealing with small fires in containers of cooking oils or fats and fires involving clothing. Heavy-duty fire blankets are for industrial use where thereis a need for the blankets to resist penetration by molten materials.3.2 Fixed firefighting installationsThese are firefighting systems which are normally installed within the structure of the building. They may already be provided in your premises or you may be considering them as a means of protecting some particularly dangerous or risk-critical area as part of your risk-reduction strategy.Hose reelsPermanent hose reels (Figure 20) installed in accordance with the relevant British Standard (BS EN 671-3: 200021) provide an effective firefighting facility. They may offer an alternative, or be in addition to, portable firefighting equipment. A concern is that untrained people will stay and fight a fire when escape is the safest option. Where hose reels are installed, and your fire risk
assessment expects relevant staff to use them in the initial stages of a fire, they should receive appropriate training.Note: It is not safe to fight fires involving aerosols with hose reels.Maintenance of hose reels includes visual checks for leaks and obvious damage and should be carried out regularly. More formal maintenance checks should be carried out at least annually by a competent person.Figure 20: Hose reelSprinkler systemsSprinkler systems can be very effective in controlling fires. They can be designed to protect life and/or property and may be regarded asa cost-effective solution for reducing the risks created by fire. Where installed, a sprinkler system is usually part of a package of fire precautions in a building and may form an integral part of the fire strategy for the building.Sprinkler protection could give additional benefits, such as a reduction in the amount of portable firefighting equipment necessary,and the relaxation of restrictions in the design of buildings.
Guidance on the design and installation of new sprinkler systems and the maintenance of all systems is given in the Loss Prevention Council (LPC) Rules or BS EN 1284522 or BS 5306-260 andshould only be carried out by a competent person.Routine maintenance by on-site personnel may include checking of pressure gauges, alarm systems, water supplies, any anti-freezing devices and automatic booster pump(s).A competent maintenance contractor should provide guidance on what records need to be completed.Following a sprinkler operation the sprinkler system should be reinstated by a competent person. A stack of spare sprinkler bulbs should be available on site for replacements, preferably in a seperate building e.g. the pumphouse.If a sprinkler system forms an integral part of your fire strategy it is imperative that adequate management procedures are in place to cater for those periods when the sprinkler system is not functional. This should form part of your emergency plan. Although the actual procedures will vary, such measures may include the following:ï Restore the system to full working order as soon as possible.ï Limit any planned shutdown to low-risk periods when numbers of people are at a minimum (e.g. at night) or when the building is not in use. This is particularly important when sprinklers are installed to a life safety standard or form part of the fire safety engineering requirements.ï You may need to isolate the area without the benefit of working sprinklers from the rest of the premises by fire-resisting material.ï Avoid higher-risk processes such as ‘hot-work’.ï Extra staff should be trained and dedicated to conducting fire patrols.ï Any phased or staged evacuation strategy may need to be suspended. Evacuation should be immediate and complete. (Exercise caution as the stairway widths may have been designed for phased evacuation only.)ï Inform the local fire and rescue service.If, having considered all possible measures, the risk is still unacceptable then it will be necessary to close all or part of the building. If in doubt you should seek guidance from a competent person.
Other fixed installationsThere are a number of other fixed installations including water mist, gaseous, deluge and fixed powder systems. If your premises have a fixed firefighting system that you are unfamiliar with, then seek advice. Where a fixed firefighting system forms an integral part of your fire safety strategy, it should be maintained in accordance with the relevant British Standard by a competent person.3.3 Other facilities (including those for firefighters)Building Regulations and other Acts, including local Acts, may have required firefighting equipment and other facilities to be provided for the safety of people in the building and to help firefighters. Fire safety law places a duty on you to maintain such facilities in good working order and at all times.These may include:ï access for fire engines and firefighters;ï firefighting shafts and lifts;ï fire suppression systems e.g. sprinklers, water mist and gaseous;ï smoke-control systems;ï dry or wet rising mains and firefighting inlets;ï information and communication arrangements e.g. fire telephones and wireless systems and information to brief the fire and rescue service when they arrive; andï firefighters’ switches.The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 199223 also require that systems provided for safety within a workplace are maintained.Access for fire engines and firefighters Buildings that have been constructed to modern building regulations or in accordance with certain local Acts will have been provided with facilities that allow fire engines to approach and park within a reasonable distance so that firefighters can use their equipment without too much difficulty.These facilities may consist of access roads to the building, hard standing areas for fire engines and access into the building for firefighters.It is essential that where such facilities are

provided they are properly maintained and available for use at all relevant times.Where a building is used by a number of different occupants you will need to ensure co-operation between the various ‘responsible ‘persons’ to maintain fire and rescue service access. In exceptional cases, where access ispersistently obstructed, you may need to make additional arrangements.See Approved Document B to the Building Regulations for more information.24Firefighting shafts and liftsFirefighting shafts (Figure 21) are provided in larger buildings to help firefighters reach floors further away from the building’s access point. They enable firefighting operations to start quickly and in comparative safety by providing a safe route from the point of entry to the floor where the fire has occurred.Figure 21: Firefighting shaftEntry points from a stairway in a firefighting shaft to a floor will be via a lobby, through two sets of fire and smoke-resisting doors and walls. Many people will use the stairway for normal movement through the building and it is important that the safety features are not compromised by doors being wedged open.Most firefighting shafts will also incorporate a firefighting lift which opens into the lobby.The lift will have a back-up electrical supply
and car control overrides. The primary function of the lift is to transport firefighting personnel and their equipment to the scene of a firewith the minimum amount of time and effort. It may also be used to help evacuate less mobile people.Alterations that might affect the shaft should not be made without first liaising with other responsible persons, any owners or managing agents and the enforcing authority. Any proposed changes will require Building Regulation approval from a Building Control Body.Where a firefighting shaft is provided, it should be maintained by a competent person.Suppression systemsFire suppression systems can include sprinklers and other types of fixed installations designed to automatically operate and suppress a fire.Such systems should be maintained by a competent person.Smoke control systemsThese are complex systems that are provided for life safety of occupants, assistance to firefighters and property protection by clearing hot smoke and gases from the building. If you have one of these systems provided in your premises you should ensure you understand how it operates and that it is maintained in full working order. If your system is part of a larger system then you should liaise with other occupiers and building managers.The smoke control system should be maintained by a competent person who is familiar with the fire engineering performance specificationsof that specific system.Where these systems are installed in addition to a sprinkler system, then the design and installation of each system should not act detrimentally on one another. A competent person should be employed to confirm this.Dry and wet rising fire mainsThe rising fire main (Figure 22) is an important facility for the fire and rescue service in taller buildings. It consists of an inlet box where firefighters can connect their hoses, a pipe running up or through the building, outlet valves on each floor level and an air ventat the top.
Figure 22: Rising main
It is important that fire mains remain in good working order. Issues to be considered can include the following:ï The physical approach to the inlet box should be such that a fire engine can park within 18 m with the inlet box in view.ï Prohibit car parking in front of the inlet box.ï Secure the inlet box in such a way that firefighters can open the door without too much difficulty.ï It is advisable to lock the landing valves in the closed position, usually with a leather strap and padlock.Foam inletsFoam intlets are special inlets are usually fitted to provide an efficient way of extinguishing a fire in a basement or other area of high risk such as plant room. In many respects they look the same as rising main inlet boxes, but the door should be clearly marked ‘foam inlet’. The risk area should be kept clear of obstructions to allow the foam to spread into the compartment.Maintenance of rising mains and foam inlets All types of rising mains and foam inlets together with associated valves should be maintained and tested on a regular basis by a competent person. Although there are no recommended periods between maintenance checks it would be prudent to carry out an annual service.
Firefighters’ switchesSafety switches are normally provided to isolate high voltage luminous signs or to cut off electrical power. In the case of existing installations, if they have been provided in accordance with previous legislation (e.g. the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 198225), then it is likely that they will comply with the Order. If this is not the case, then you may need to consult the enforcing authority regarding the suitability of its location and marking. Testing should be carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. If you have no such instructions then an initial test should be carried out by a competent electrician.Other firefighting facilitiesAs well as those already mentioned, other facilities to assist firefighters may have been installed in your premises, and should be properly maintained by a competent person. Your maintenance audit (see Appendix A for an example checklist) should include these. Such facilities can include:ï information signs for firefighters;ï static water supplies, private hydrants, meter bypass valves and underground tanks;ï standby fire pumps, electrical generators, air pumps and hydraulic motors; andï manual/self-closing devices for roller shutter doors in fire compartment walls.ï 
Section 4 Further guidance on escape routes
IntroductionThis section provides further guidance on the general principles that apply to escape routes and provides examples of typical escape route solutions for a range of common building layouts. The guidance is based on premises of normal risk so if your premises (or part of your premises) are higher (or lower) risk you should adapt the solution accordingly.You are not obliged to adopt any particular solution for escape routes in this section if you prefer to meet the relevant requirement in some other way. If you decide to adopt some alternative arrangement it will need to achieve at least an equivalent level of fire safety.Refer to the glossary (Appendix D) for the definitions of any terms you may not be familiar with.Levels of riskIn order to apply the guidance in this section, you need to understand that in any fire situation, the time that people have to escape before they could become affected by the fire is limited.Providing them with sufficient time usually means that as well as having an appropriate way of detecting and giving warning in case of fire, the distance that people have to travel to make their escape to a place of reasonable or total safety must be restricted.The travel distances which are usually appropriate for this purpose (and are suggested later in this section) vary according to the level of risk in the premises (or part of them). To check your escape routes you will need to form a judgement about the level of risk that people may be at after you have taken other risk reduction (preventative and protective) measures.In premises where there is a likelihood of a fire starting and spreading quickly (or a fire could start and grow without being quickly detected and a warning given) and affect the escape routes before people are able to use them, then the risk should normally be regarded at ‘higher’. Such premises could include those where significant quantities of
flammable materials are used or stored; ready sources of ignition are present, e.g. heat producing machinery and processes; premises where significant numbers of the people present are likely to move slowly or be unable to move without assistance; and premises where the construction provides hidden voids or flues through which a fire could quickly spread.In premises where there is a low occupancy level and all the occupants are able bodied and capable of using the means of escape without assistance; very little chance of a fire; few if any highly combustible or flammable materials or other fuels for a fire; fire cannot spread quickly; and will be quickly detected so people will quickly know that a fire has occurred and can make their escape, then the risk can usually be regarded as ‘lower’.In most cases however, the risk will usually be ‘normal’.The travel distances suggested are not hard and fast rules and should be applied with a degree of flexibility according to the circumstances. For example, in premiseswhere the risk might otherwise be considered ‘normal’ but where there are a significant number of people who move slowly or may need assistance to evacuate, it would usually be appropriate to consider this a ‘higher’ risk. However, where other measures are in place to mitigate this, such as the availability of extra assistance and this has been planned for in your emergency plan, it may be that the risk level can be regarded as ‘normal to higher’.Equally, in premises where the risk category would otherwise be ‘lower’ but for the fact that a small number of occupants may move slowly or need assistance, it may be appropriate to categorise the risk as ‘normal’ in these circumstances.If you are not sure about the level of risk that remains in your premises, you should seek advice from a competent person.
4.1 General principlesSuitability of escape routesYou should ensure that your escape routes are:ï suitable;ï easily, safely and immediately usable at all relevant times;ï adequate for the number of people likely to use them;ï free from any obstructions, slip or trip hazards; andï available for access by the emergency services.In multi-occupied premises, escape routes should normally be independent of other occupiers, i.e. people should not have to go through another occupier’s premises as the route may be secured or obstructed. Where this is not possible, then robust legal agreements should be in place to ensure their availability at all times.All doors on escape routes should open in the direction of escape and ideally be fitted with a safety vision panel. This is particularly important if more than 60 people use them or they provide an exit from an area of high fire risk.At least two exits should be provided if a room/area is to be occupied by more than 60 persons. This number of 60 can be varied in proportion to the risk; for a lower risk there can be a slight increase, for a higher risk, lower numbers of persons should be allowed.Movement of persons up or down a group of not less than three steps will be so obvious to those following that they will be prepared for the change in level, but movement up or down one step is not so readily observed and may easily lead to a fall. Wherever practicable, differences of level in corridors, passages and lobbies should be overcome by the provision of inclines or ramps of gradients not exceeding 1 in 12 or steps not having less than three risers in any flight. Corridors and passages should be level for a distance of 1.5 metres in each direction from any steps.Any mirrors situated in escape routes should be sited so that persons escaping from a fire will not be thrown into confusion by any reflected image of the route they are using, or be misled as to the direction they should take to reach fire exits
While not normally acceptable, the use of ladders, floor hatches, wall hatches or window exits may be suitable for small numbers of able-bodied, trained staff in exceptional circumstances.Fire-resisting constructionThe type and age of construction are crucial factors to consider when assessing the adequacy of the existing escape routes. To ensure the safety of people it may be necessary to protect escape routes from the effects of a fire. In older premises (see Appendix C for more information on historical properties) it is possible that the type of construction and materials used may not perform to current fire standards. Also changes of occupier and refurbishment may have led to:ï cavities and voids being created, allowing the potential for a fire to spread unseen;ï doors and hardware worn by age and movement being less likely to limit the spread of smoke;ï damaged or lack of cavity barriers in modular construction; andï breaches in fire compartment walls, floors and ceilings created by the installation of new services, e.g. computer cabling.Where an escape route needs to be separated from the rest of the premises by fire-resisting construction, e.g. a dead-end corridor or protected stairway (see Figures 31 and 35 on pages 74 and 78 respectively), then you should ensure the following:ï Doors (including access hatches to cupboards, ducts and vertical shafts linking floors) walls, floors and ceilings protecting escape routes should be capable of resisting the passage of smoke and fire for long enough so that people can escape from the building.ï Where suspended or false ceilings are provided, the fire resistance should extend up to the floor slab level above. For means of escape purposes a 30 minutes fire-resisting rating is normally enough.ï Cavity barriers, fire stopping and dampers in ducts are appropriately installed.If there is any doubt about the nature of the construction of your premises, ask for advice from a competent person.

Number of people using the premisesAs your escape routes need to be adequate for the people likely to use them you will need to consider how many people, including employees and the public, may be present at any one time. Where premises have been subject to building regulations approval for use as either an office or a shop, the number and width of escape routes and exits will normally be enough for the anticipated number of people using the building. In such buildings where the risk has changed or buildings were constructed before national Building Regulations it is still necessary to confirm the provision.For offices, the maximum numbers of staff, visitors and contractors liable to be in the building at the same time will be known by the responsible person. For shops, the responsible person will normally be aware of the maximum number of people liable to be present from a personal knowledge of trading patterns. There will also be an appreciation of the use of the building by those with special needs, such as the disabled.If you propose to make changes to the use or layout of the building which may increase the number of people, you should check the design capacity by referring to guidance given in the Building Regulations Approved Document B.24
Mobility impairmentEffective management arrangements need to be put in place for those that need help to escape.Consider the following points:ï A refuge is a place of reasonable safety in which disabled people can wait either for an evacuation lift or for assistance up or down stairs (see Figure 23). Disabled people should not be left alone in a refuge area whilst waiting for assistance with evacuation from the building. Depending on the design and fire resistance of other elements, a refuge could be a lobby, corridor, part of a public area or stairway, or an open space such as a flat roof, balcony or similar place which is sufficiently protected (or remote) from any fire risk and provided with its own means of escape and a means of communication.ï Where refuges are provided, they should be enclosed in a fire-resisting structure which creates a protected escape route which leads directly to a place of total safety and should only be used in conjunction with effective management rescue arrangements. Your fire safety strategy should not rely on the fire and rescue service rescuing people waiting in these refuges.ï If firefighting lifts (provided in high buildings as firefighting access) are to be used for evacuation, this should be co-ordinated with the fire and rescue service as part of the pre-planned evacuation procedures.ï Normal lifts may be considered suitable for fire evacuation purposes, subject to anadequate fire risk assessment and development of a suitable fire safety strategy by a competent person.ï Since evacuation lifts can fail, having reached a refuge a disabled person should also be able to gain access to a stairway (should conditions in the refuge become untenable). An evacuation lift with its associated refuge should therefore be located adjacent to a protected stairway.ï Enough escape routes should always be available for use by disabled people. This does not mean that every exit will need to be adapted. Staff should be aware of routes suitable for disabled people so that they can direct and help people accordingly.ï 
ï Stairways used for the emergency evacuation of disabled people should comply withthe requirements for internal stairs in the building regulations. Specialist evacuation chairs or other equipment may be necessary to negotiate stairs.ï Plans should allow for the careful carrying of disabled people down stairs without their wheelchairs, should the wheelchair be too large or heavy. You will need to take into account health and safety manual handling procedures in addition to the dignity and confidence of the disabled person.ï 
Stairlifts should not be used for emergency evacuation. Where installed in a stairway used for emergency evacuation, no parts of the lift, such as its carriage rail, should be allowed to reduce the effective width of the stairway or any other part of an emergency evacuation route.ï Where ramps are necessary for the emergency evacuation of people in wheelchairs they should be as gentle as possible. Ramps should be constructed in accordance with Approved Document M.62Further guidance is available in BS 5588-863 and BS 5588-12.52
Figure 23: An example of a refuge

Widths and capacity of escape routes and stairwaysOnce you have established the maximum number of people likely to be in any part of the premises, the next step is to establish that the capacity of the escape routes is adequate for people to escape safely in sufficient time to ensure their safety in case of fire.The capacity of a route is determined by a number of factors including the width of the route, the time available for escape and the ability of the persons using them.The effective usable width of an escape route is the narrowest point, normally a door or other restriction such as narrowing of a corridor due to fixtures and fittings. The capacity of an escape route is measured by the number of persons per minute that can pass through it, so to establish the capacity of the route, it is first necessary to measure the width of the route at the narrowest point. The effective width of a doorway is the clear unobstructed width through the doorway when the door is open at right angles to the frame. The effective width at any other point is the narrowest clear unobstructed width through which people can pass.The time available for escape depends on several factors. Studies of human behaviour in an emergency situation have shown that about two thirds of the time available to escape is taken up by the initial reaction to the developing situation. For example, people will decide whether the situation is real or false, often waiting to see the reaction of people around them, and generally gathering information to decide whether to act or not. The final third is taken up by the actual movement away from the area of the fire. Throughout this time the fire may be growing and spreading. Therefore to account for the limited available time for people to travel to a place of reasonable safety, the length of escape routes needs to be restricted. The suggested travel distances in this section (Table 2 on page 68) take this restriction into account.The following guide can be used to determine the general capacities of escape routes:
A width of at least 750mm can accommodate up to:ï 80 people in higher risk premises;ï 100 people in normal risk premises; orï 120 people in lower risk premises.A width of at least 1050mm can accommodate up to:ï 160 people in higher risk premises;ï 200 people in normal risk premises; orï 240 people in lower risk premises.An additional 75mm should be allowed for each additional 15 persons (or part of 15).Note: The minimum width of an escape route should not be less than 750mm (unless it is for use by less than five people in part of your premises) and, where wheelchair users are likely to use it, not less than 900mm.The aggregate width of all the escape routes should be not less than that required to accommodate the maximum numbers of people likely to use them.When calculating the overall available escape route capacity for premises that have more than one way out, you should normally assume that the widest is not available because it has been compromised by fire. If doors or other exits leading to escape routes are too close to one another you should consider whether the fire could affect both at the same time. If that is the case, it may be necessary to discount them both from your calculation.As a general rule stairways should be at least 1050mm wide and in any case not less than the width of the escape routes that lead to them. In all cases the aggregate capacity of the stairways should be sufficient for the number of people likely to have to use them in case of fire.Stairways wider than 2100mm should normally be devided into sections, each separated from the adjacent section by a handrail, so that each section measured between the handrails is not less than 1050mm wide.
Travel distanceHaving established the number and location of people and the exit capacity required to evacuate them safely, you now need to confirm that the number and location of existing exits is adequate. This normally determined by the distance people have to travel to reach them.Table 2 gives guidance on travel distances.It should be understood, however, that these distances are flexible and may be increasedor decreased depending upon the level of risk after you have put in place the appropriate fire-prevention measures (Part 1, Step 3.3).In new buildings which have been designed and constructed in accordance with modern building standards the travel distances will already have been calculated. Once you have completed your fire risk assessment you need to confirm that those distances are still relevant.
When assessing travel distances you need to consider the distance to be travelled by people when escaping, allowing for walking around furniture or display material etc. (see Figure 24). The distance should be measured from all parts of the premises (e.g. from the most remote part of an office or shop on any floor) to the nearest place of reasonable safety which is:ï a protected stairway enclosure (a storey exit);ï a separate fire compartment from which there is a final exit to a place of total safety; orï the nearest available final exit.ï 
Table 2: Suggested travel distancesEscape routesSuggested range of travel distanceWhere more than one escape route is provided25m in higher fire-risk area1 45m in normal fire-risk area 60m in lower fire-risk area2Where only a single escape route is provided12m in higher fire-risk area1 18m in normal fire-risk area 25m in lower fire-risk area2Note 1:Where there are small high-risk areas this travel distance should apply. Where the risk assessment indicates that the whole building is high- risk, ask advice from a competent person.Note 2:The travel distance for lower risk premises should only be applied in exceptional cases in the very lowest risk premises where densities are low, occupants are familiar with the premises, excellent visual awareness, and very limited combustibles.

The travel distances given in Table 2 are based on those recommended in Approved Document B of the Building Regulations24 and are intended to complement the other fire safety recommendations in ApprovedDocument B. Your current escape route travel distances may be different from these since they may be based on recommendations made in alternative guidance.Where your route leads to more than one final exit, but only allows initial travel in a single direction (e.g. from a room or dead end, see Figures 28 and 29), then this initial travel distance should be limited to that for a ‘single escape route’ in Table 2. However, your total travel distance should not exceed that for ‘more than one escape route’.
Measuring travel distanceThe figures that follow are schematic and are intended to represent part of a larger building.The route taken through a room or space will be determinted by the layout of the contentse.g. work stations, aisle layout (Figure 24). It is good practice to ensure routes to the exits are kept as direct and short as possible. In a small room there may be only one exit but in a larger room or area there may be many exits.In some cases where the contents are moved around or the space is liable to frequent change, e.g. in a storage area or where racking is moveable you should ensure that the exits, or the routes to them, do not become blocked or the length of the route is not significantly extended.
Figure 24: Measuring travel distance
Inner roomsWhere the only way out of a room is through another room (Figure 25), an unnoticed fire in the outer room could trap people in the inner room. This means of exit should be avoided where possible. If, however, this cannot be achieved then adequate warning of a fire should be provided by any one of the following means:ï a vision panel between the two rooms providing adequate vision to give an indication of the conditions in the outer room and the means of escape;ï a large enough gap between the dividing wall and the ceiling, e.g. 500mm, so that smoke will be seen; orï an automatic smoke detector in the outer room that will sound a warning in the inner room.
In addition, the following points should also be considered:ï Restrict the number of people using an inner room to 60.ï Access rooms should be under the control of the same person as the inner room.ï The travel distance from any point in the inner room to the exit from the access room should be restricted to escape in one direction only (see Table 2 on page 68), unless there are alternative exits from the access room.ï No one should have to pass through more than one access room while making their escape.ï The outer room should not be an area of high fire risk.ï 
Figure 25: Inner rooms
Alternative exitsWhere alternative exits from a space or room are necessary, they should wherever possible be located at least 45° apart (see Figure 26) unless the routes to them are seperated by fire-resisting construction (see Figure 27). If in doubt consult a competent person.Figure 26: Alternative exitsFigure 27: Alternative exits seperated by fire-resisting construction
Measuring travel distances for initial dead-end travelWhere the initial direction of travel in an open area (see Figure 28) or within an inner room (see Figure 29) is in one direction only the travel distance (A–B) should be limited tothat for a ‘single escape route’ in Table 2 on page 68.
Any alternative exits should be positioned to ensure a fire will not compromise both exits. The maximum total travel distance recommended in Table 2 should apply to the nearest exit (Figure 28 and 29, distance A–C). However, since you have two exits, your total travel distance should not exceed that for ‘more than one escape route’ in Table 2.

Figure 29: Measuring travel distance from initial dead end (inner room)
Escape routes with dead-end conditionsIf your premises has escape routes from which escape can be made in one direction only(a dead end), then an undetected fire in that area could affect people trying to escape. To overcome this problem, limit the travel distance (see Table 2) and use one of the following solutions:ï Fit an automatic fire detection and warning system in those areas where a fire could present a risk to the escape route (see Figure 30).ï 
Protect the escape route with fire-resisting construction to allow people to escape safely past a room in which there is a fire (see Figure 31).ï Provide an alternative exit (see Figure 32).Alternative approaches may be acceptable, although expert advice may be necessary.

Basement, escape and protectionIn all buildings with basements (other than very small basements), stairways serving upper floors should preferably not extend to the basement and in any case should not do so where they are the only stairway serving the upper floors. Any stairway that does extend from the basement to the upper floors should be seperated at basement level by a fire resisting lobby or corridor between the basement and the stairway. All basements used by more than 60 people or where there are no exits directly to a place of total safety, should have at least two protected escape stairways.In high risk premises there should be an alternative stairway from the basement to ground level unless there is a suitable alternative route to the final exit.Wherever possible all stairways to basements should be entered at ground level from the open air, and should be positioned so that smoke from any fire in the basement would not obstruct any exit serving the other floors of the building.
Where any stairway links a basement with the ground floor, the basement should be separated from the ground floor, preferably by two30-minute fire doors, one at basement and one at ground floor level (see Figure 33).Any floor over a basement should provide 60 minutes fire resistance. For smaller premises 30 minutes may be acceptable. Where this is impractical, and as long as no smoke can get through the floor, automatic smoke detection linked to a fire-alarm system which is audiblethroughout the premises could, as an alternative, be provided in the basement area. If in doubt, contact a competent person for moredetailed advice.

Subdivision of corridorsIf your premises has corridors more than 30m long, then generally these corridors should be subdivided near the centre of the corridor with fire doors and, where necessary, fire-resisting construction to limit the spread of fire and smoke and to protect escape routes if thereis a fire.Where a corridor serves two exits from a floor, generally these corridors should be subdivided with fire doors to separate the two exits (see Figure 34).Doors that are provided solely for the purpose of restricting the travel of smoke need not be fire doors, but will be suitable as long as they are of substantial construction, are capable of resisting the passage of smoke, and are self- closing. Smoke should not be able to bypass these doors, e.g. above a false ceiling, or via alternative doors from a room, or adjoining rooms, opening on either side of the subdivision.
Generally, false ceilings should be provided with barriers or smoke stopping over any fire doors. Where the false ceiling forms part of the fire- resisting construction this may not be necessary.If you have doubts about subdivision of corridors, ask advice from a competent person.Stairway enclosuresStairways if unprotected from fire can rapidly become affected by heat and smoke cutting off the escape route and allowing fire to spread to other floors. However if adequately protected, escape stairways can be regarded as places of reasonable safety to enable people to escape to a place of total safety.In most premises which are served by more than one stairway, it is probable that these stairways will be protected by fire-resisting construction and will lead to a final exit. If any floor has an occupancy of over 60 each storey should have at least two exits i.e. protected routes. The figure
Figure 34: Subdivision of corridor between two stairways or exits
of 60 can be varied in proportion to the risk, lower risk slight increase, higher risk lower numbers of persons.It is possible that you may have some stairways which have no fire protection to them. In this case they are not designed for escape and are normally known as accommodation stairways (see accommodation stairways on page 81).If you have a protected stairway(s) then it is essential that you maintain that level of fire protection.The benefit of protecting stairways from the effects of fire allows you to measure your travel distance from the furthest point on the relevant floor to the nearest storey exit rather than the final exit of the building.If the building you occupy has floors which are occupied by different companies to your own you need to consider, as part of your fire risk assessment, the possibility that a fire may occur in another part of the building over which you may have no control and which may affectthe protected stairway if allowed to develop unchecked. If your fire risk assessment shows that this may be the case and people using any
floor would be unaware of a developing fire, then additional fire-protection measures may be required, e.g. an automatic fire-detection and warning system. If this is required you will need to consult and co-operate with other occupiers and building managers.You may find that stairways in your building are provided with protected lobbies or corridors at each floor level (except the top floor) (Figure 35). Although these are not generally necessary for means of escape in multi-stairway buildings of less than 18m high, they may have been provided for other reasons (e.g. firefighting access). In all case protected corridors, lobbies and stairways must be kept clear of combustibles and obstructions.In taller buildings (in general those over five storeys, excluding basements), the person who has overall control of common areas of the building may need to seek advice from a competent person.
Figure 35: Examples of a stairway with protected lobby/corridor approach
Ideally stairway enclosures should lead directly to a final exit. If your premises has only one stairway from the upper floor(s) which does not lead directly to a final exit, adopt one of the following arrangements:ï provide a protected route from the foot of the stairway enclosure leading to a final exit (Figure 36); orï 
provide two exits from the stairway, each giving access to a final exit via routes which are separated from each other by fire-resisting construction (Figure 37).ï 
Figure 36: Examples of a protected route from a stairway to a final exitFigure 37: Examples of two escape routes from a stairway to final exits
Figure 38: Separation of protected stairways
Separation of protected stairways Where there are two or more protected stairways, the routes to final exits should beseparated by fire-resisting construction so that fire cannot affect more than one escape route at the same time (see Figure 38).
Creating a stairway bypass routeNo one should have to pass through a protected stairway to reach another stairway. Options to avoid this include:ï using intercommunicating doors between rooms adjacent to the stairway, such doors must be available at all times when the building is occupied (see Figure 39);ï using balconies and other features to bypass the stairway; orï as long as there is enough space, create a bypass corridor around the stairway enclosure.ï 
Figure 39: A stairway bypass route
Reception areasReception or enquiry areas should only be located in protected stairways where the stairway is not the only one serving the upper floors, the reception area is small (less than 10m2) and is of low fire risk.Accommodation stairwaysIf you have stairways that are used for general communication and movement of people in the premises, and they are not designatedas fire escape stairs then these are called ‘accommodation stairways’. They may not require fire separation from the remainder of the floor as long as they do not pass through
a compartment floor, or people do not have to pass the head of such a stairway in order to access a means of escape stairway. However, experience shows that many people will continue to use these as an escape route.Accommodation stairways, escalators and travelators should not normally form an integral part of the calculated escape route capacity, however, where your fire risk assessment indicates that it is safe to do so, then you may consider them for that purpose.In these circumstances it may be necessary to seek advice from a competent person to verify this.
External stairwaysTo be considered a viable escape route, an external stairway should normally be protected from the effects of a fire along its full length.This means that any door, window (other than toilet windows) and walls within 1.8m horizontally and 9m vertically below any part of the stairway should be fire-resisting.Windows should be fixed shut and doors self- closing (Figure 40).Figure 40: Protection to an external stairway

These should not normally be used for members of the public, particularly where large numbers are likely to use them.Consider protecting the external stairway from the weather as the treads may become slippery, e.g. due to algae, moss or ice. If this is not possible, you must ensure that the stairway is regularly maintained. Consider fixing non-slip material to the treads.Spiral and helical stairwaysSpiral and helical stairways are usually acceptable only in exceptional situations, e.g. for a maximum of 50 people who are not members of the public. The stairway should not be more than 9m in total height and not less than 1.5m in diameter with adequate headroom. A handrail should be continuous throughout the full length of the stairway.However, spiral and helical stairways may be used as means of escape by more than 50 staff and may be used by the public if the stairways have been designed for the purpose. Further guidance is given in BS: 5395-2.26 However, they are not usually suitable for young children.LiftsDue to the danger of the power supplies to a lift being affected by a fire, lifts not specifically designed as ‘firefighting’ or ‘evacuation’ lifts are not normally considered acceptable as a means of escape. However, where a lift and stairway for a means of escape are incorporated in a fire-resisting shaft which has a final exit fromit at the access level and the lift has a separate electrical supply to that of the remainder of the building, than that lift subject to an agreed fire risk assessment, may be acceptable as a means of escape in case of fire.Lifts are housed in vertical shafts that interconnect floors and compartments, therefore precautions have to be taken to protect people from the risk of fire and smoke spreading from floorto floor via the lift shaft. Such precautions may include:ï separating the lift from the remainder of the storey using fire-resisting construction and access via a fire door;ï ensuring the lift shaft is situated in a protected enclosure which may also be a stairway enclosure; andï providing ventilation of at least 0.1m2 at the top of each lift-well to exhaust any smoke.
Roof exitsIt may be reasonable for an escape route to cross a roof. Where this is the case, additional precautions will normally be necessary:ï The roof should be flat and the route across it should be adequately defined and well- illuminated where necessary with normal electric and emergency escape lighting. The route should be non-slip and guarded with a protective barrier.ï The escape route across the roof and its supporting structure should be constructed as a fire-resisting floor.ï Where there are no alternatives other than to use a roof exit, any doors, windows, roof lights and ducting within 3m of the escape route should be fire-resisting.ï Where an escape route passes through or across another person’s property, you will need to have a robust legal agreement in place to allow its use at all times when people are on your premises.ï The exit from the roof should be in, or lead to, a place of reasonable safety where people can quickly move to a place of total safety.A typical escape route across a roof is illustrated in Figure 41.External escape routes should receive routine inspection and maintenance to ensure they remain fit for use. You will need to ensure that any legal agreements in place cover access for maintenance of the escape route.

Revolving doors, wicket doors, sliding doors and roller shuttersRevolving doors should not normally be considered as escape doors unless the leaves fold outward to form a clear opening upon pressure from within or standard doors of the required exit width are provided next to the revolving door.Ideally wicket doors or gates should have a minimum opening height of 1.5m. The bottom of the door should not be more than 250mm above the floor and the width should be preferably more than 500mm but not less than 450mm. Normally wicket doors will only be suitable for up to 15 members of staff however, in areas of a higher fire risk, this should be reduced to a maximum of three.
Loading and goods delivery doors, shutters (roller, folding or sliding), up-and-over doors and similar openings are not normally suitable for use as a final exit. However, they may be suitable for escape from areas of normal risk by small numbers of staff as long as they are not likely to be obstructed and can be easily and immediately opened manually, even if normally power-operated and the staff are familiar with the escape routes.Sliding doors are not normally suitable on escape routes unless they are for the sole use of members of staff. Where provided, a notice with the words ‘slide to open’ with an arrow pointing in the direction of opening, should be permanently displayed at about eye level on the face of the door.

Final exit doors and escape away from the premisesGood escape routes to a final exit will be of little benefit if the occupants are not able to get out of the building and quickly disperse from the area to a place of total safety. It is also important to consider where people will go once they have evacuated from the premises.The matters that you should consider include the following:ï Final exit doors should be quickly and easily openable without a key or code in the event of a fire. Where possible, there should be only one fastening. See Appendix B3 for more information on security fastenings.ï Final exit doors should not lead people into an enclosed area from which there is no further escape.ï Where a final exit discharges into an enclosed area, further access to a place of total safety should be available by means of further doors or gates that can be easily opened in a manner similar to the final exit.4.2 Escape route layoutThe examples listed in Table 3 on page 86 show typical escape route solutions for a range of common building layouts. In each case the solution is for a normal risk building unless otherwise illustrated.These are not intended to be prescriptive or exhaustive but merely to help you understand how the principles of means of escape may be applied in practice.They are illustrative of the key features of escape route layouts and not intended to be real building layouts or to scale.You do not need to read all of this section, you only need to consider those figures and the accompanying text which most closely resemble your premises. If your premises do not resemble these then you should seek advice from a competent person. These examples are intended to represent your existing layout; they are not to be used as design guidance.
In all of these examples the following basic principles apply:ï The farthest point on any floor to the final exit or storey exit to a protected stairway is within the overall suggested travel distance (see Table 2).ï The route to and the area near the exit is kept clear of combustibles and obstructions.ï The fire-resisting stairway is kept clear of combustibles and obstructions.ï The escape route leads to a final exit.ï Where the stairway is not a protected stairway, the final exit is visible and accessible from the discharge point of the stairway at ground floor level.ï High-risk rooms do not generally open directly into a protected stairway.ï If your fire risk assessment shows that people using any floor would be unaware of a fire you may require additional fire- protection measures, e.g. an automatic fire-detection and warning system.ï There should be more than one escape route from all parts of the premises (rooms or storeys) except for areas or storeys with an occupancy of less than 60. The figure of 60 can be varied in proportion to the risk, for a lower risk there can be a slight increase, for a higher risk, lower numbers of persons should be allowed.ï

Single-storey buildings(or the ground floor of a larger building)Ground floor premises with a single exit (may include a mezzanine)Part of your premises may have only a single exit. The example shown in Figure 42will be generally acceptable provided that part of the premises served only by a single exit accommodates no more than 60 people in total.If your fire risk assessment shows that people using mezzanine or cellular offices/stores would be unaware of fire elswhere in the building, it may require additional fire-protection measures, e.g. an automatic fire-detection and warning system.Note: A mezzanine covering more than half of the floor area may need to be treated as a separate floor (see two-storey building).Figure 42: Ground floor premises with a single exit (including a mezzanine)

Three-storey premises, including basement In premises with a basement, ground and first floor, served by individual stairways the layout in Figure 47 will be generally acceptable as long as the following apply:ï The basement should accommodate no more than 60 people.ï The first floor should accommodate no more than 60 people.ï 
The farthest point in the basement to the door to the stairway is within the overall suggested travel distance (see Table 2, page 68).ï The stairway from the basement to ground floor level is enclosed by fire-resisting construction and leads to a final exit.ï The farthest point on the first floor to the final exit is within the overall suggested travel distance.ï

To overcome the restriction of travel distance the stairway has been completely enclosed in 30 minute fire-resisting construction and all doors onto the stairway are self-closing fire doors.ï The furthest point on all of the floors to the storey exit is within the overall suggested travel distance (see Table 2 page 68).ï Where the building incorporates a basement, any stairway from the basement is separated by a protected lobby or corridor between that basement andthe protected stairway.

Office premises, ground and up to three upper storeysIn office premises only, with a ground floor and up to three upper storeys served by a single stairway, it is important to understand that you are unlikely to be able to meet the suggested travel distance to a final exit (see Table 2 page 68). In these circumstances it is necessary to protect the stairway by a fire- resisting enclosure as shown (Figure 49).If the building you occupy has floors which are occupied by different companies to your own, you need to consider, as part of your fire risk assessment, the possibility that a fire may occur in another part of the building over which you may have no control and which may affect the protected stairway if allowed to develop unchecked. If your fire risk assessment shows that this may be the case and people using any floor would be unaware of a developing fire, you may require additional fire-protection measures, e.g. an automatic fire-detection and warning system. If this is required you will need to consult and co-operate with other occupiers and building managers.The layout shown in Figure 49 will be generally acceptable as long as the following apply:ï The upper floors or any basement should each accommodate no more than 60 people.ï The furthest point on all of your floors to the storey exit is within the overall suggested travel distance (see Table 2 page 68).ï Where the building incorporates a basement, any stairway from the basement is separated by a fire-resisting lobby or corridor between that basement and the protected stairway.Where your building has more than three upper storeys and a single stairway you should ask advice from a competent person.
Figure 49: Office premises, ground and up to three upper storeys
Shop premises, ground and up to three upper storeysBecause of the higher risk posed by shop premises, and to protect the escape route by preventing smoke from entering the stairway, a protected lobby or corridor approach between the stairway and all floors (other than the top floor) should be provided as shown in Figure 50.The layout shown in Figure 50 will be generally acceptable as long as the following apply:ï The upper floors should each accommodate no more than 60 people.ï The furthest point on all of your floors to the lobbied storey exit is within the overall suggested travel distance (see Table 2 page 68).ï When a protected lobby or corridor approach to the stairway is employed the travel distance is measured to the storey exit and not the door to the lobby or corridor.Alternatively automatic fire detection on all floors may be used instead of protected lobbies or corridors (see Figure 51), however, the stairway must still be protected. If the building you occupy has floors which are occupied by different companies to your own, you need to consider, as part of your fire risk assessment, the possibility that a fire may occur in another part of the building over which you may have no control and which may affect the protected stairway if allowed to develop unchecked. If your fire risk assessment shows that this may be the case and people using any floor would be unaware of a developing fire, you may require additional fire-protection measures, e.g. an automatic fire-detection and warning system. If this is required you will need to consult and co-operate with other occupiers and building managers.If your building has more than three upper storeys and a single stairway, ask advice from a competent person.

Multi-storey buildings with more than one stairwayExample of a multi-storey buildingThe layout shown in Figure 52 illustrates these principles. You also need to consider the following:ï Where the building incorporates a basement any stairway from the basement should be separated by a protected lobby or corridor between that basement and the protected stairway.ï 
If you do not have a protected stairway and, depending on the outcome of your fire risk assessment, it may be that you can achieve an equivalent level of safety by other means. However, it is strongly recommended that you ask advice from a competent person.ï These principles apply to taller buildings (with floors up to 18m high), however where your building has more than three upper storeys you should ask the advice of a competent person.ï

Section 5 Further guidance on emergency escape lighting
The primary purpose of emergency escape lighting is to illuminate escape routes but it also illuminates other safety equipment.The size and type of your premises and the risk to the occupants will determine the complexity of the emergency escape lighting required.Borrowed lighting may be suitable in small premises where the light is from a dependable source, e.g. street lamps, and it will adequately illuminate escape routes. Where borrowed lighting is not suitable, then a number of torches, in strategic positions, can be considered.Single ‘stand-alone’ escape lighting units may be sufficient in small premises and these can sometimes be combined with exit or directional signs (Figure 54). The level of general illumination should not be significantly reduced by the sign.In larger more complex premises a more comprehensive system of fixed automatic escape lighting is likely to be needed. This will be particularly true in premises with extensive basements or where there are significant numbers of staff or members of the public.You will have identified the escape routes when carrying out your fire risk assessment and need to ensure that they are all adequately lit. If there are escape routes that are not permanently illuminated by normal lighting, such as external stairs, then a switch, clearly marked ‘Escape lighting’, or some othermeans of switching on the lighting should be provided at the entry to that area/stairs.An emergency escape lighting system should normally cover the following:ï each exit door;ï escape routes;ï intersections of corridors;ï outside each final exit and on external escape routes;ï emergency escape signs;ï 
stairways so that each flight receives adequate light;ï changes in floor level;ï windowless rooms and toilet accommodation exceeding 8m2;ï firefighting equipment;ï fire alarm call points;ï equipment that would need to be shut down in an emergency;ï lifts; andï areas in premises greater than 60m2.It is not necessary to provide individual lights (luminaires) for each item above, but there should be a sufficient overall level of lightto allow them to be visible and usable.Emergency escape lighting can be both ‘maintained’, i.e. on all the time, or ‘non- maintained’ which only operates when the normal lighting fails. Systems or individual lighting units (luminaires) are designed to operate for durations of between one and three hours. In practice, the three-hour design is the most popular and can help with maintaining limited continued use of the premises during a power failure (other thanin an emergency situation).Figure 54: Luminaires

Emergency escape lighting (luminaires) can be stand-alone dedicated units or incorporated into normal light fittings. There are highly decorative versions of these for those areas that demand aesthetically pleasing fixtures. Power supplies can be rechargeable batteries integral to each unit, a central battery bank or an automatic start generator.To complement emergency escape lighting, people, especially those unfamiliar with the premises, can be helped to identify exit routes by the use of way-guidance equipment. Way- guidance systems usually comprise photo- luminescent material, lines of LEDs, or strips of miniature incandescent lamps, forming a continuous marked escape route at lower level (Figure 55). These systems have proved particularly effective when people have toescape through smoke, and for partially-sighted people. They can be particularly useful in premises where they can provide marked routes on floors and in multi-storey premises they can direct people to escape routes which are seldom used.If you decide that you need to install emergency escape lighting or to modify your existing system, any work should be carried out by a competent person in accordance with the appropriate standards. Further guidance is given in BS 5266-128 and BS 5266-8.27Figure 55: A ‘way-guidance’ system
Maintenance and testing of emergency escape lightingAll emergency escape lighting systems should be regularly tested and properly maintained to an appropriate standard. Most existing systems will need to be manually tested. However, some modern systems have self-testing facilities that reduce routine checks to a minimum.Depending on your type of installation you should be able to carry out most of the routine tests yourself. The test method will vary. Ifyou are not sure how to carry out these tests you should contact your supplier or other competent person.Figure 56: A test keyTest facilities often take the form of a ‘fishtail’ (Figure 56) key inserted in a special switch either near the main fuse board or adjacent to relevant light switches.Typically, testing would include:ï a daily visual check of any central controls;ï a monthly function test by operating the test facility for a period sufficient to ensure that each emergency lamp illuminates; andï an annual full discharge test.Particular care needs to be taken following a full discharge test. Batteries typically take24 hours to re-charge and the premises should not be re-occupied until the emergency lighting system is fully functioning unless alternative arrangements have been made. See BS 5266-827 for more information.It is good practice to keep a record of tests.
Section 6 Further guidance on signs and notices
Escape signsIn simple premises, a few signs indicating the alternative exit(s) might be all that is needed. In larger and more complex premises, a series of signs directing people along the escape routes towards the final exit might be needed.Many people with poor vision retain some sight and are able to recognise changing or contrasting colour to provide them with visual clues when moving around a building.* 102It may sufficient to paint any columns and walls in a contrasting colour and to highlight changes in level by, for example, making the nosingto step and stair treads a contrasting colour (see BS 830014).For people with no sight, a well-managed ‘buddy system’, continuous handrails or a sound localisation system (which helps people to move towards an alert sound), or the installation of more tactile aids may be appropriate.Exit signs should be clearly visible whenever the public, staff and contractors are present.Positioning of escape signsThe presence of other signs in shops (such as advertising and customer information) or shop dressing, can distract attention from, or obscure the visibility of escape signs. This could affect people’s ability to see and understand escape signs, particularly if there is a fire evacuation. Always ensure that escape signs are not overwhelmed.Escape signs should meet the following criteria:ï They should provide clear, unambiguous information to enable people to safely leave a building in an emergency.ï Every escape route sign should, where necessary, incorporate, or be accompanied by, a directional arrow. Arrows should not be used on their own.ï If the escape route to the nearest exit is not obvious then it should be indicated by a sign(s).ï Signs should be positioned so that a person escaping will always have the next escape route sign in sight.ï 
Escape signs should be fixed above the door in the direction of escape and not be fixed to doors, as they will not be visible if the door is open.ï Signs mounted above doors should be at a height of between 2.0m and 2.5m above the floor.ï Signs on walls should be mounted between1.7m and 2.0m above the floor.ï Mounting heights greater than 2.5m may be used for hanging signs, e.g. in large open spaces or for operational reasons, but care should be taken to ensure that such signs are both conspicuous and legible. In such case larger signs may be necessary.ï Signs should be sited at the same height throughout the escape route, so far as is reasonably practicable.Escape sign designFor a sign to comply with safety signs and signals regulations it must be pictographic (see Figures 57 and 58). The pictogram can be supplemented by text if this is considered necessary to make the sign easily understood(BS-type sign), but you must not have a safety sign that uses only text. Either type of sign can be used but different types should notbe mixed. Appropriate signs should take into account the needs of those who may need to use them.The legibility of escape signs is determinedby the size of the sign, its level of illumination and the distance over which it is viewed. The use of signs within the same premises should follow a consistent design pattern or scheme. You should not rely on a few outsized signs which may encourage people to travel to a particular escape route when other more appropriate routes should be used.In multi-occupied premises, co-operation between the respective ‘responsible persons’ should be sought to ensure that, as far as possible, all signs in the building conform to a single pattern or scheme.

Figure 57: BS-type signFigure 58: Euro signOther safety signs and noticesA number of other mandatory signs such as ‘Fire action’ notices may also be necessary.Fire doors that have been fitted with self- closing devices should be labelled ‘Fire door – keep shut’ (Figure 59) on both sides. fire- resisting doors to cupboards, stores and service ducts that are not self-closing because they are routinely kept locked should be labelled ‘Fire door – keep locked’ on the outside.Figure 59: Fire door ‘keep shut’ notice
Signs should indicate non-automatic fire safety equipment if there is any doubt about its location, e.g. fire extinguishers that are kept in cabinets or in recesses.A notice with the words ‘Push bar to open’ should be permanently displayed immediately above the push-bar on all doors fitted with a panic bolt or panic latch.A notice with the words ‘Fire escape – keep clear’ should be permanently displayed at about eye level on the external face of all doors which are provided as a means of escape in case of fire and which, because they are not normally used, may become obstructed.Staff noticesIn simple premises where there are a limited number of escape routes, it may be reasonable to provide staff with verbal reminders of what they need to do if there is a fire. In some premises, you could consider providing this in a short written statement that could, for example, be delivered with staff pay slips every six months.In multi-occupied, larger and more complex premises or where there is a high turnover of staff, a more considered approach for staff notices and instructions will be necessary. As well as positioning the fire instructions notice on escape routes adjacent to fire break-glass call points (Figure 60), put them where staff frequently assemble in the premises, e.g. the canteen and locker rooms.Figure 60: Staff action notice

If your premises are routinely expected to accommodate people whose first language is not English you may need to consider providing instruction in more than one language. The interpretation should always convey an identical message.IlluminationAll signs and notices will need illumination to ensure they are conspicuous and legible. There are a number of options available to achieve this, such as:ï external illumination; andï internal illumination.The supplier or other competent person can give you further advice.Signs or notices of the photo-luminescent type,i.e. where the active material making up the luminous parts of such signs or notices needs a period of exposure to light before they become visible in darkness (but get fainter with time), are not a substitute for appropriate emergency lighting and should only be used where other forms of illumination are present.Further guidanceDetailed guidance on fire safety signs can be found in BS 5499-4,30 BS 5499-5.74 Published guidance5,6 on compliance with health and safety legislation on signs is also available.Guidance about the use of photo-luminescent fire safety signs and notices can be foundin BS 5266-6.73104
Section 7 Further guidance on recording, planning, informing, instructing and training
7.1 Fire safety recordsKeeping up-to-date records of your fire risk assessment can help you effectively manage the fire strategy for your premises and demonstrate how you are complying with fire safety law.Even if you do not have to record the fire risk assessment, it can be helpful to keep a record of any co-operation and exchange of information made between employers and other responsible people for future reference.In larger and more complex premises, it is best to keep a dedicated record of all maintenance of fire-protection equipment and training.There is no one ‘correct’ format specified for this. Suitable record books are available from trade associations and may also be available from your local enforcing authority.In all cases the quality of records may also be regarded as a good indicator of the overall quality of the safety management structure.Your records should be kept in a specified place on the premises (for example, in the management’s office), and should include:ï details of any significant findings from the fire risk assessment and any action taken (see Part 1, Section 4.1);ï testing and checking of escape routes, including final exit locking mechanisms, such as panic devices, emergency exit devices and any electromagnetic devices;ï testing of fire-warning systems, including weekly alarm tests and periodic maintenance by a competent person;ï recording of false alarms;ï testing and maintenance of emergency lighting systems;ï testing and maintenance of fire extinguishers, hose reels and fire blankets etc.;ï if appropriate, testing and maintenance of other fire safety equipment such as fire-suppression systems and smoke control systems;ï 
recording and training of relevant people and fire evacuation drills;ï planning, organising, policy and implementation, monitoring, audit and review;ï maintenance and audit of any systems that are provided to help the fire and rescue service;ï the arrangements in a large multi-occupied building for a co-ordinated emergency plan or overall control of the actions you or your staff should take if there is a fire; andï all alterations, tests, repairs and maintenance of fire safety systems, including passive systems such as fire doors.Other issues that you may wish to record include:ï the competence, qualifications and status of the persons responsible for carrying out inspections and tests;ï the results of periodic safety audits, reviews, inspections and tests, and any remedial action taken;ï all incidents and circumstances which had the potential to cause accidents and monitor subsequent remedial actions; andï a record of the building use, the fire prevention and protection measures in place and high-risk areas.You should ensure that no other management decisions or policies compromise safety.Your documentation should be available for inspection by representatives of the enforcing authority.More detailed advice is given in BS 5588-12.52Figure 61 is an example of how to record some individual stages of the process in more detail. A blank version of this form is provided in Appendix A2.

Notes:(1) The risk assessment record of significant findings should refer to other plans, records or other documents as necessary.(2) The information in this record should assist you to develop an emergency plan; coordinate measures with other ‘responsible persons’ in the building; and to inform and train staff and inform other relevant persons.(1) 

In premises with ‘engineered fire safety strategies’, a fire policy manual should be providedin addition to any other records. Enforcing authorities would expect a fire engineering policy manual to conform to the structure set out in BS 7974-0 section 5: Reporting and presentation.31Fire safety auditA fire safety audit can be used alongside your fire risk assessment to identify what fire safety provisions exist in your premises.When carrying out a review of your fire safety risk assessment, a pre-planned audit can quickly identify if there have been any significant changes which may affect the fire safety systems and highlight whether a full fire risk assessment is necessary.Plans and specificationsPlans and specifications can be required to assist understanding of a fire risk assessmentor emergency plan. Even where not needed for this purpose they can help you and your staff keep your fire risk assessment and emergency plan under review and help the fire and rescue service in the event of fire. Any symbols used should be shown on a key. Plans and specifications could include the following:ï essential structural features such as the layout of function rooms, escape doors, wall partitions, corridors, stairways etc. (including any fire-resisting structure and self-closing fire doors provided to protect the escape routes);ï location of refuges and lifts that have been designated suitable for use by disabled people and others who may need assistance to escape in case of fire;ï methods for fighting fire (details of the number, type and location of the firefighting equipment);ï location of manually-operated fire alarm call points and control equipment for fire alarms;ï location of any control rooms and any fire staff posts;ï location of any emergency lighting equipment and the exit route signs;ï location of any high-risk areas, equipment or process that must be immediately shut down by staff on hearing the fire alarm;ï 
location of any automatic firefighting systems, risers and sprinkler control valves;ï location of the main electrical supply switch, the main water shut-off valve and, where appropriate, the main gas or oil shut-off valves; andï plans and specifications relating to all recent constructions.This information should be passed on to any later users or owners of the premises.7.2 Emergency plansEmergency plan and contingency plans Your emergency plan should be appropriate to your premises and could include:ï how people will be warned if there is a fire;ï what staff should do if they discover a fire;ï how the evacuation of the premises should be carried out;ï where people should assemble after they have left the premises and procedures for checking whether the premises have been evacuated;ï identification of key escape routes, how people can gain access to them and escape from them to a place of total safety;ï arrangements for fighting the fire;ï the duties and identity of staff who have specific responsibilities if there is a fire;ï arrangements for the safe evacuation of people identified as being especially at risk, such as those with disabilities, lone workers and young persons;ï any machines/appliances/processes/power supplies that need to be stopped or isolated if there is a fire;ï specific arrangements, if necessary, for high-fire-risk areas;ï contingency plans for when life safety systems such as evacuation lifts, fire-detection and warning systems, sprinklers or smoke control systems are out of order;ï how the fire and rescue service and any other necessary services will be called and who will be responsible for doing this;ï procedures for meeting the fire and rescue service on their arrival and notifying them of any special risks, e.g. the location of highly flammable materials;ï 
ï what training employees need and the arrangements for ensuring that this training is given;ï phased evacuation plans (where some areas are evacuated while others are alerted but not evacuated until later); andï plans to deal with people once they have left the premises.As part of your emergency plan it is good practice to prepare post-incident plans for dealing with situations that might arise such as those involving:ï unaccompanied children;ï people with personal belongings (especially valuables) still in the building;ï people wishing to rejoin friends;ï getting people away from the building (e.g. to transport); andï inclement weather.You should therefore prepare contingency plans to determine specific actions and/or the mobilisation of specialist resources.Guidance on developing health and safety management policy has been published by the HSE.327.3 Information, instruction,co-operation and co-ordinationSupplying informationYou must provide easily understandable information to employees, the parents of children you may employ, and to employers of other persons working in your premises about the measures in place to ensure a safe escape from the building and how they will operate, for example:ï any significant risks to staff and other relevant persons that have been identified in your fire risk assessment or any similar assessment carried out by another user and responsible person in the building;ï the fire prevention and protection measures and procedures in your premises and where they impact on staff and other relevant persons in the building;ï the procedures for fighting a fire in the premises; andï 
the identity of people who have been nominated with specific responsibilities in the building.Even if you do not have to record the fire risk assessment, it would be helpful to keep a record of any co-operation and exchange of information made between employers and other responsible people for future reference.You need to ensure that all staff and, where necessary, other relevant persons in the building, receive appropriate information in a way that can be easily understood. This might include any special instructions to particular people who have been allocated a specific task, such as shutting down equipment or guiding people to the nearest exit.Duties of employees to give information Employees also have a duty to take reasonable care for their own safety and that of other people who may be affected by their activities. This includes the need for them to inform their employer of any activity that they consider would present a serious and immediate danger to their own safety and that of others.Dangerous substancesHSE publishes guidance8 about specific substances where appropriate information may need to be provided. If any of these, or any other substance that is not included but nevertheless presents more than a slight risk, is present in your premises, then you must provide such information to staff and others, specifically you must:ï name the substance and the risks associated with it, e.g. how to safely use or store the product to avoid creating highly flammable vapours or explosive atmospheres;ï identify any legislative provisions that may be associated with the substance;ï allow employees access to the hazardous substances safety data sheet; andï inform the local fire and rescue service where dangerous substances are present on the premises.ï 

Information to the fire and rescue services In addition to providing information to the fire and rescue service when dangerous substances are present in sufficient quantities to pose an enhanced risk, it will also be helpful to inform them of any short term changes that might have an impact on their firefighting activities,e.g. in the event of temporary loss of a firefighting facility and temporary alterations.Procedures should also include meeting and briefing the fire and rescue service when they arrive.InstructionYou will need to carefully consider the type of instructions to staff and other people working in your premises. Written instructions mustbe concise, comprehensible and relevant and therefore must be reviewed and updated as new working practices and hazardous substances are introduced.
Inclusive access and employment policies mean that people with learning difficulties may now be present in a range of premises and your fire risk assessment should consider whether further instruction or guidance is necessary to ensure that your evacuation strategy is appropriate and understood by everyone.Instructions will need to be given to people delegated to carry out particular tasks, for example:ï removing additional security, bolts, bars or chains on final exit doors before the start of business to ensure that escape routes are accessible;ï daily, weekly, quarterly and yearly checks on the range of fire safety measures (in larger premises some of the work may be contracted out to a specialist company);ï safety considerations when closing down the premises at the end of the day, e.g. removing rubbish, ensuring enough exits are available for people that remain and closing fire doors and shutters;ï leaving hazardous substances in a safe condition when evacuating the building;ï the safe storage of hazardous substances at the end of the working day; andï ensuring everyone in large organisations with many buildings within a curtilage and a security zone know how to use internal emergency telephones.Specific instructions may be needed about:ï how staff will help members of the public/ visitors to leave the building;ï ‘sweeping’ of the shop floor by staff to guide people to the nearest exit when the fire alarm sounds;ï designating particular areas of a shop/ office for supervisors to check that no one remains inside;ï calling the emergency services;ï carrying out evacuation roll calls;ï taking charge at the assembly area;ï meeting and directing fire engines; andï cover arrangements when nominated people are on leave.ï 
Co-operation and co-ordinationWhere you share premises with others (this includes people who are self-employed or in partnership), each responsible person, i.e. each employer, owner or other person who has control over any part of the premises, will need to co-operate and co-ordinate thefindings of their separate fire risk assessments to ensure the fire precautions and protection measures are effective throughout the building. This could include:ï co-ordinating an emergency plan (see Step 4.2 for features of an emergency plan);ï identifying the nature of any risks and how they may affect others in or about the premises;ï identifying any fire-prevention and protection measures;ï identifying any measures to mitigate the effects of a fire; andï arranging any contacts with external emergency services and calling the fire and rescue service.7.4 
Fire safety trainingStaff trainingThe actions of staff if there is a fire are likely to be crucial to their safety and that of other people in the premises. All staff should receive basic fire safety induction training and attend refresher sessions at pre-determined intervals.You should ensure that all staff and contractors are told about the emergency plan and are shown the escape routes.The training should take account of the findings of the fire risk assessment and be easily understood by all those attending. It should include the role that those members of staff will be expected to carry out if a fire occurs.This may vary in large premises, with some staff being appointed as fire marshals or being given some other particular role for which additional training will be required.In addition to the guidance given in Part 1, Step 4.4, as a minimum all staff should receive training about:ï the items listed in your emergency plan;ï the importance of fire doors and other basic fire-prevention measures;ï where relevant, the appropriate use of firefighting equipment;ï the importance of reporting to the assembly area;ï exit routes and the operation of exit devices, including physically walking these routes;ï general matters such as permitted smoking areas or restrictions on cooking other than in designated areas; andï assisting disabled persons where necessary.Training is necessary:ï when staff start employment or are transferred into the premises;ï when changes have been made to the emergency plan and the preventive and protective measures;ï where working practices and processes or people’s responsibilities change;ï to take account of any changed risks to the safety of staff or other relevant persons;ï 

ï to ensure that staff know what they have to do to safeguard themselves and others on the premises;ï where staff are expected to assist disabled persons; andï if a member of staff may take on the role of duty manager.Training should be repeated as often as necessary and should take place during working hours.Whatever training you decide is necessary to support your fire safety strategy and emergency plan, it should be verifiable.Enforcing authorities may want to examine records as evidence that adequate training has been given.Fire marshalsStaff expected to undertake the role of fire marshals (often called fire wardens) would require more comprehensive training. Their role may include:ï helping those on the premises to leave;ï checking the premises to ensure everyone has left;ï using firefighting equipment if safe to do so;ï liaising with the fire and rescue service on arrival;ï shutting down vital or dangerous equipment; andï performing a supervisory/managing role in any fire situation.Training for this role may include:ï detailed knowledge of the fire safety strategy of the premises;ï awareness of human behaviour in fires;ï how to encourage others to use the most appropriate escape route;ï how to search safely and recognise areas that are unsafe to enter;ï the difficulties that some people, particularly if disabled, may have in escaping and any special evacuation arrangements that have been pre-planned;ï additional training in the use of firefighting equipment;ï 
an understanding of the purpose of any fixed firefighting equipment such as sprinklers or gas flooding systems; andï reporting of faults, incidents and near misses.Fire drillsOnce the emergency plan has been developed and training given, you will need to evaluate its effectiveness. The best way to do this is to perform a fire drill. This should be carried out at least annually or as determined by your fire risk assessment. If you have a high staff turnover, you may need to carry them out more often.A well-planned and executed fire drill will confirm understanding of the training and provide helpful information for future training. The responsible person should determine the possible objectives of the drill such as to:ï identify any weaknesses in the evacuation strategy;ï test the procedure following any recent alteration or changes to working practices;ï familiarise new members of staff with procedures; andï test the arrangements for disabled people.Who should take part?Within each building the evacuation should be for all occupants except those who may need to ensure the security of the premises, or people who, on a risk-assessed basis, are required to remain with particular equipment or processes that cannot be closed down.Premises that consist of several buildings on the same site should be dealt with one building at a time over an appropriate period unless the emergency procedure dictates otherwise.Where appropriate, you may find it helpful to include members of the public in your fire drill – ensuring that all necessary health and safety issues are addressed before you do so.Carrying out the drillFor premises that have more than one escape route, the escape plan should be designed to evacuate all people on the assumption that one exit or stairway is unavailable because of the fire. This could be simulated by a designated person being located at a suitable point on an exit route. Applying this scenario to different escape routes at each fire drill will encourage individuals to use alternative escape routes which they may not normally use.
When carrying out the drill you might find it helpful to:ï circulate details concerning the drill and inform all staff of their duty to participate. It may not be beneficial to have ‘surprise drills’ as the health and safety risks introduced may outweigh the benefits;ï ensure that equipment can be safely left;ï nominate observers;ï inform the alarm receiving centre if the fire-warning system is monitored (if the fire and rescue service is normally called directly from your premises, ensure that this does not happen);ï inform visitors and members of the public if they are present; andï ask a member of staff at random to set off the alarm by operating the nearest alarm call point using the test key. This will indicate the level of knowledge regarding the location of the nearest call point.More detailed information on fire drills and test evacuations are given in BS 5588-12.52The roll call/checking the premises have been evacuatedWhere possible, you should ensure that a roll call is carried out as soon as possible at the designated assembly point(s), and/or receive reports from wardens designated to ‘sweep’ the premises. You should note any people who are unaccounted for. In a real evacuation this information will need to be passed to the fire and rescue service on arrival.Check that people have assembled at the evacuation point.Once the roll call is complete or all reports have been received, allow people to return to the building. If the fire-warning system is monitored inform the alarm receiving centre that the drill has now been completed and record the outcomes of the drill.
Monitoring and debriefThroughout the drill the responsible person and nominated observers should pay particular attention to:ï communication difficulties with regard to the roll call and establishing that everyone is accounted for;ï the use of the nearest available escape routes as opposed to common circulation routes;ï difficulties with the opening of final exit doors;ï difficulties experienced by people with disabilities;ï the roles of specified people, e.g. fire wardens;ï inappropriate actions, e.g. stopping to collect personal items, attempting to use lifts etc.; andï windows and doors not being closed as people leave.On-the-spot debriefs are useful to discuss the fire drill, encouraging feedback from everybody. Later, reports from fire wardens and observations from people should be collated and reviewed. Any conclusions and remedial actions should be recorded and implemented.
Section 8 Quality assurance of fire protection equipment and installationFire protection products and related services should be fit for their purpose and properly installed and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions or the relevant British Standard.Third-party certification schemes for fire protection products and related services are an effective means of providing the fullest possible assurances, offering a level of quality, reliability and safety that non-certificated products may lack. This does not mean goods and services that are not third-party approved are less reliable, but there is no obvious way in which this can be demonstrated.Third-party quality assurance can offer comfort both as a means of satisfying you that goods and services you have purchased are fit for purpose, and as a means of demonstrating that you have complied with the law.However, to ensure the level of assurance offered by third party schemes, you should always check whether the company you employ sub-contracts work to others. If they do, you will want to check that the sub- contractors are subject to the same level of checks of quality and competence as the company you are employing.Your local fire and rescue service, fire trade associations or your own trade association may be able to provide further details about third- party quality assurance schemes and the various organisations that administer them.

Appendix BTechnical information on fire-resisting separation, fire doors and door fastenings
B1 Fire-resisting separationGeneralThe materials from which your premises are constructed may determine the speed with which a fire may spread, affecting the escape routes that people will use. A fire starting in a building constructed mainly from readily combustible material will spread faster than one where modern fire-resisting constructionmaterials have been used. Where non-combustible materials are used and the internal partitions are made from fire-resisting materials, the fire will be contained for a longer period, allowing more time for the occupants to escape.Because of the requirements of the Building Regulations you will probably already have some walls and floors that are fire-resisting and limitations on the surface finishes to certain walls and ceilings.You will need to consider whether the standard of fire resistance and surface finishing in the escape routes is satisfactory, has been affected by wear and tear or alterations and whether any improvements are necessary.The following paragraphs give basic information on how fire-resisting construction can provide up to 30 minutes protection to escape routes. This is the standard recommended for most situations. If you are still unsure of the levelof fire resistance which is necessary after reading this information, you should consult a fire safety expert.
Fire-resisting constructionThe fire resistance of a wall or floor is dependent on the quality of construction and materials used. Common examples of types of construction that provide 30-minute fire resistance to escape routes if constructed to the above standards are:ï internal framed construction wall, non-load bearing, consisting of 72mm x 37mm timber studs at 600mm centres and faced with 12.5mm of plasterboard with all joints taped and filled (see Figure 62);ï internal framed construction, non-load bearing, consisting of channel section steel studs at 600mm centres faced with 12.5mm of plasterboard with all joints taped and filled; andï masonry cavity wall consisting of solid bricks of clay, brick earth, shale, concrete or calcium silicate, with a minimum thickness of 90mm on each leaf.There are other methods and products available which will achieve the required standard of fire resistance and may be more appropriate for the existing construction in your premises. If there is any doubt about how your building is constructed, then ask for further advice from a competent person.
Figure 62: Fire-resisting construction
Fire-resisting floorsThe fire resistance of floors will depend on the existing floor construction as well as the type of ceiling finish beneath. If you need to upgrade the fire resistance of your floor it may not be desirable to apply additional fire resistance to the underside of an existing ornate ceiling. In older buildings there may be a requirement to provide fire resistance between beams and joists.A typical example of a 30-minute fire-resisting timber floor is tongue and groove softwood of not less than 15mm finished thickness on 37mm timber joists, with a ceiling below of onelayer of plasterboard to a thickness of 12.5mm with joints taped and filled and backed by supporting timber.There are other, equally valid, methods and products available for upgrading floors.If you are in any doubt you should ask the advice of a competent person and ensure that the product is installed in accordance with instructions from the manufacturer or supplier.Fire-resisting glazingThe most common type of fire-resisting glazing is 6mm Georgian wired glazing, which is easily identifiable. Clear fire-resisting glazing is available and can quickly be identified by a mark etched into the glass, usually in the corner of the glazed panel, to confirm its fire-resisting standard.Although this is not compulsory, the marking
of glass is supported by the Glass and Glazing Federation; you should check whether the glazing will be marked accordingly before purchase.The glazing should have been installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and to the appropriate standard,66 to ensurethat its fire-resisting properties are maintained.The performance of glazed systems in terms of fire resistance and external fire exposure should, wherever possible, be confirmed by test evidence. Alternatively, where there is a lack of test information, ask for an assessment of the proposed construction from suitably qualified people.Fire separation of voidsA common problem encountered with fire separation is fire-resisting partitions which do not extend above false ceilings to true ceiling height. This may result in unseen fire spread and a loss of vital protection to the escape routes. It is important therefore to carefully check all such partitions have beeninstalled correctly.CLASP and SCOLA type construction CLASP (Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme) and SCOLA (Second Consortium of Local Authorities) are total or systematic methods of construction that were developed to provide consistent building quality, while reducing the need for traditional skilled labour.
They consist of a metal frame upon which structural panels are fixed. This results in hidden voids through which fire may spread. It is important that cavity barriers that restrict the spread of fire are installed appropriately, especially to walls and floors that need to be fire-resisting. If you are in any doubt as to whether any remedial work will be required, then ask for advice from a competent person.Breaching fire separationTo ensure effective protection against fire, walls and floors providing fire separation must form a complete barrier, with an equivalent level of fire resistance provided to any openings such as doors, ventilation ducts, pipe passages or refuse chutes.The passing of services such as heating pipes or electrical cables through fire-resisting partitions leaves gaps through which fire and smoke may spread. This should be rectified by suitablefire stopping and there are many proprietary products available to suit particular types of construction. Such products should be installed by competent contractors.Décor and surface finishes of walls, ceilings and escape routesThe materials used to line walls and ceilings can contribute significantly to the spread of flame across their surface. Most materials that are used as surface linings will fall into one of three classes of surface spread of flame.The following are common examples of acceptable materials for various situations:Class 0: Materials suitable for circulation spaces and escape routesï Such materials include brickwork, blockwork,concrete, ceramic tiles, plaster finishes (including rendering on wood or metal lathes), wood-wool cement slabs and mineral fibre tiles or sheets with cement or resin binding.Note: Additional finishes to these surfaces may be detrimental to the fire performance of the surface and if there is any doubt about this then consult the manufacturer of the finish.Class 1: Materials suitable for use in all rooms but not on escape routesï Such materials include all the Class 0 materialsreferred to above. Additionally, timber, hardboard, blockboard, particle board, heavy flock wallpapers and thermosetting plastics will be suitable if flame-retardant treated to achieve a Class 1 standard.
Class 3: Materials suitable for use in rooms of less than 30m2ï Such materials include all those referredto in Class 1, including those that have not been flame-retardant treated and certain dense timber or plywood and standard glass-reinforced polyesters.The equivalent European classification standard will also be acceptable. Further details about internal linings and classifications are available in Approved Document B.24 Appropriate testing procedures are detailed in BS 476-733 and where appropriate BS EN 13501-1.34Further guidance on types of fire-resisting construction has been published by the Building Research Establishment.35B2 Fire-resisting doorsRequirements of a fire-resisting door Effective fire-resisting doors (see Figure 63) are vital to ensure that the occupants can evacuate to a place of safety. Correctly specified and well-fitted doors will hold back fire and smoke, preventing escape routes becoming unusable, as well as preventing the fire spreading from one area to another.Fire-resisting doors are necessary in any doorway located in a fire-resisting structure. Most internal doors are constructed of timber. These will give some limited protection against fire spread, but only a purpose-built fire-resisting door that has been tested to an approved standard will provide the necessary protection. Metal fire-resisting doors are also available and specific guidance for these follows.All fire-resisting doors are rated by their performance when tested to an appropriate standard. The level of protection provided by the door is measured, primarily by determining the time taken for a fire to breach the integrity (E), of the door assembly, together with its resistance to the passage of hot gases and flame.It may be possible to upgrade the fire resistance of existing doors. Further information is available from the Building Research Establishment67 or Timber Research and Development Association.68
Figure 63: A fire-resisting and smoke-stopping door
Timber fire-resisting doors require a gap of 2-4mm between the door leaf and the frame.However larger gaps may be necessary to ensure that the door closes flush into its frame when smoke seals are fitted. Further information is available in BS 4787-1.69 For fire-resisting purposes the gap is normally protected by installing an intumescent seal, in either the door or, preferably, the frame. The intumescent seal expands in the early stages of a fire and enhances the protection given by the door.Additional smoke seals will restrict the spread of smoke at ambient temperatures. Doors fitted with smoke seals, either incorporated in the intumescent seal or fitted separately, havetheir classification code suffixed with a ‘S’.The principal fire-resisting door categories are:ï E20 fire-resisting door providing 20 minutes fire resistance (or equivalent FD 20S). (Note: Many suppliers no longer provide an E20 type fire-resisting door.)ï E30 fire-resisting door providing 30 minutes fire resistance (or equivalent FD 30S).ï 
E60 fire-resisting door providing 60 minutes fire resistance (or equivalent FD 60S).Timber fire-resisting doors are available that will provide up to 120 minutes fire resistance but their use is limited to more specialised conditions that are beyond the scope of this guidance.Metal fire-resisting doorsAlthough the majority of fire-resisting doors are made from timber, metal fire-resisting doors, which meet the appropriate standard, can often be used for the same purpose. However, there are situations where they are more appropriate. The majority of metal fire-resisting door manufacturers will require the use of bespoke frames and hardware for their door sets.121See BS EN 1634-136 and BS 476-2237 for more information.For detailed guidance refer to Approved Document B.24
Glazing in fire-resisting doorsAlthough glazing provides additional safety in everyday use and can enhance the appearance of fire-resisting doors, it should never reduce the fire resistance of the door. The opening provided in the door for the fire-resisting glazing unit(s) and the fitting of the beading are critical, and should only be entrusted to a competent person. In nearly all cases the door and glazing should be purchased from a reputable supplier who can provide documentary evidence that the door continues to achieve the required rating.Fire-resisting door furnitureHingesTo ensure compliance with their rated fire performance, fire-resisting doors need to be hung with the correct number, size and quality of hinges. Normally a minimum of three hinges are needed, however themanufacturer’s instructions should be closely followed. BS EN 193538 including Annex B, is the appropriate standard.Alternative door mountingsAlthough the most common method of hanging a door is to use single axis hinges, alternative methods are employed where the door is required to be double swing or mounted on pivots for other reasons.Floor mounted controlled door closing devices are the most common method regularly found with timber, glass and steel doors while transom mounted devices are commonly used with aluminium sections. In each case reference should be made to the fire test report for details as to compliance with the composition of the door assembly including the door mounting conditions.Self-closing devicesAll fire-resisting doors, other than those to locked cupboards and service ducts, should be fitted with an appropriately controlled self- closing device that will effectively close the door from any angle. In certain circumstances, concealed, jamb-mounted closing devices may be specified and in these cases should be capable of closing the door from any angle and against any latch fitted to the door; spring hinges are unlikely to be suitable. Further information is available in BS EN 1154.39Rising butt hinges are not suitable for use as a self-closing device due to their inability to close and latch the door from any angle.
Automatic door hold-open/release devices for self-closing fire doorsThese devices are designed to hold open self- closing fire doors or allow them to swing free during normal use. In the event of a fire alarm the device will then release the door automatically, allowing the self-closing mechanism to close the door.Such devices are particularly useful in situations where self-closing doors on escape routes are used regularly by significant numbers of people, or by people with impaired mobility who may have difficulty in opening the doors.Typical examples of such devices include:ï electro-magnetic devices fitted to the fire- resisting door which release when the fire detection and warning system operates, allowing a separate self-closer to close the door;ï electro-magnetic devices within the controlled door closing device which function on the operation of the fire detection and warning system; andï ‘free swing’ controlled door closing devices, which operate by allowing the door leaf to work independently of the closing device in normal conditions. An electro-magnetic device within the spring mechanism linked to the fire detection and warning system ensures that the door closes on the operation of the system.Note: Free swing devices may not be suitable in some situations, such as corridors, where draughts are a problem and the doors are likely to swing uncontrolled, causing possible difficulty or injury to certain people e.g. those with certain disabilities, the elderly and frail, or young children.Automatic door hold open/release devices fitted to doors protecting escape routes should only be installed in conjunction with an automatic fire detection and warning system incorporating smoke detectors, that is designed to protect the escape routes in the building (see Part 2, Section 2).In all cases the automatic device should release the fire-resisting door allowing it to close effectively within its frame when any of the following conditions occur:ï the detection of smoke by an automatic detector;ï 

ï the actuation of the fire detection and alarm system by manual means e.g. operation of break glass call point;ï any failure of the fire detection and alarm system; orï any electrical power failure.Other devices, including self-contained devices which perform a similar function, that are not connected directly to a fire alarm system and are not therefore able to meet the above criteria are available and may be acceptable where a site specific risk assessment can show that they are appropriate. Such devices are unlikely to be suitable for use on doors protecting single stairways or other critical means of escape.In all cases where a door hold open device is used it should be possible to close the door manually.A site specific risk assessment should be undertaken before any type of automatic door hold open/release device is installed. If you are unsure about the suitability of such devices in your premises, you should seek the advice of a competent person.Further guidance about automatic door hold open/release devices is given in BS EN 115570 or BS 5839-3.41Door co-ordinatorsWhere pairs of doors with rebated meeting stiles are installed it is critical that the correct closing order is maintained. Door coordinators to BS EN 115871 should be fitted and fully operational in all cases where the doors are self-closing.Installation and workmanshipThe reliability and performance of correctly specified fire-resisting doors can be undermined by inadequate installation. It is important that installers with the necessary level of skill and knowledge are used. Accreditation schemes for installers of fire-resisting doors are available.Fire-resisting doors and shutters will require routine maintenance, particularly to power operation and release and closing mechanisms.Further information is available on fire-resisting doors in BS 8214.42 If you are unsure about the quality, the effectiveness or the fitting of your fire-resisting doors consult a fire safety expert.

Careful planning and the use of quality materials remain the most effective means of satisfying both of these objectives.Any device that impedes people making good their escape, either by being unnecessarily complicated to manipulate or not being readily openable, will not be acceptable.Guidance on fire exits starts from the position that doors on escape routes should not be fitted with any locking devices (electrically operated or otherwise). However, it is accepted that in many cases the need for security will require some form of device that prevents unlimited access, but still enables the occupants of a building or area to open the door easily if there is a fire. These devices can take many forms but, in the majority of cases, premises where there are members of the public present or others who are not familiar with the building should use panic exit bar devices (i.e. push bars or touch bars). See BS EN 112543 for further information.Premises that have limited numbers of staff or others who are familiar with the building and where panic is not likely may use alternative devices (i.e. push pads or lever handles).See BS EN 17944 for further information.In some larger premises, when only staff are on the premises and there is a security issue, it may be acceptable to restrict the number of emergency exits immediately available,e.g. when only security staff are present at night, or prior to opening the premises in the morning. Staff should be made fully aware of any restrictions and the number of exits not immediately available should be limited.
Electrical locking devicesElectrically operated entry control devices have been developed for use as locking devices on fire exits. They fall into two main categories, electromechanical and electromagnetic.ï Electromechanical devicesElectromechanical devices comprise electromechanical lock keeps and draw bolts, which can be controlled by people inside the premises by entering a code or by using ‘smart cards’, which have been adapted to control the exit from certain areas. These devices have been fitted in many premises and may be linked to the fire-detection and/or warning system.Experience has shown that these devices can fail to open in a number of ways. They are dependent on a spring mechanism to return the lock keep or draw bolt(s) and are liable to jam when pressure is applied to the door. It is also relatively easy to fit them incorrectly. Electromechanical locking devices are normally unacceptable on escape doors, unless they are fitted witha manual means of overriding the locking mechanism, such as a push bar, push pad or lever handle or they do not rely on a spring mechanism, fail-safe open and are not affected by pressure, in which case the criteria for electromagnetic devices should be applied.ï Electromagnetic devicesThese devices comprise a magnet and a simple fixed retaining plate with nomoving parts and are therefore generally considered to be more reliable due totheir inherent ‘fail-safe unlocked’ operation. Electromagnetic locking devices go some way to addressing the particular concerns surrounding electromechanical locking systems. The release of this type of device is controlled by the interruption of electrical current to an electromagnet either manually via a switch or other means, break-glass point (typically coloured green), or by linking to the fire-warning and/or detection system of the premises.Time-delay devices on escape routesA further development is the fitting of a time- delay system to the electronic door-locking device. This delays the actual opening of an exit door for a variable period following operation of the panic bar or other exit device. Periods of between five and 60 seconds can
be pre-set at the manufacturing stage or can be adjusted when fitted. These are not usually acceptable for use by members of the public. However, they may be acceptable for use by staff who are familiar with their operation and are suitably trained in their use.Management of electronic door-control devices including time delaysThe use of such devices may be accepted by enforcing authorities if the responsible person can demonstrate, through a suitable risk assessment for each individual door, both the need and the adequate management controls to ensure that people can escape safely from the premises. In particular:ï Access control should not be confused with exit control. Many devices are available which control the access to the premises but retain the immediate escape facility from the premises.ï In public areas, when push bars are operated on escape doors, they should release the electromagnetic locks immediately and allow the exit doors to open.ï The requirement for exit control should be carefully assessed and should not be seen as a substitute for good management of the employees and occupants.ï All other alternatives should have been explored/evaluated prior to using these devices to ensure they do not affect the safety of occupants.ï The device should be connected to the fire warning and/or detection system.ï The device should incorporate a bypass circuit for immediate release on activation of the fire warning and/or detection system.ï Each door should be fitted with a single securing device.ï The emergency exit doors should be clearly labelled about how to operate them.ï Adequate control measures should be put in place to ensure the safety of the occupants.The use of electronic door-locking devices should be considered with particular care in premises with a number of different occupancies.The management of a complicated system of evacuation for many different groups is unlikely to be practicable.The technical standards in respect of sourcing, maintaining and testing must be extremely high.
When part of the management control system involves trained personnel helping others at these doors, it is vital to ensure these people are available.The use of exit control devices should not be considered where the number of trained staff is low or where members of the public would be expected to operate the devices without help.In premises where there may be large numbers of people, the devices should only be considered when linked to a comprehensive automaticfire-detection and warning system in accordance with BS 5839-1.16 There should be an additional means of manually overriding the locking device at each such exit (typically a green break-glass point).The use of time-delay systems that prevent the opening of emergency exits for a pre-set time are primarily used to improve security. These add a further layer of complexity to the fire strategy and should not be considered in public areas. They should only be used in non-public areas when all other options such as relocating valuable stock or exterior boundary management have been addressed. Their value in preventing theft is likely to be transient as the use of the manual override becomes more widely known.British Standard 822045 gives further advice on security in buildings and while this standard does refer to electronic locking devices, it also acknowledges that the balance must remain on the side of emergency escape rather than security.
Historic buildings
General considerationsThis appendix offers additional information about listed and historical buildings.Fire risk assessments conducted for a office or shop which is within a listed or historic building will need to endeavour to strike a balance between ensuring sufficient fire safety measures are in place for the safety of people, yet avoid extensive alterations and helping to maintain the character of the building.As well as the fire risk assessment it is recommended that a general fire policy statement and manual is compiled. A person must be nominated to take responsibility for all aspects of fire safety. Usually the person charged with the management and control of the premises will be the ‘responsible person’ under the Order.1The advice and/or consent of a building control body or any other relevant bodies (e.g. English Heritage) should form part of any fire risk assessment that impacts on the character of the building (e.g. replacement of doors, fittings, wooden panelling and decor) or material changes to existing escape routes. An ideal solutionis one that is reversible, enabling the historic elements to be reinstated.A fire safety adviser will be able to suggest alternatives to conventional fire precautions, such as:ï a fire engineering solution;ï upgrading existing doors and partitions in a sympathetic manner to improve their fire resistance; andï considering the installation of specialist fire-detection or suppression systems.
Should the design and nature of the historic building preclude the introduction of conventional fire safety features, it will be necessary to manage the building in sucha way that:ï limits the number of occupants, either staff or members of the public, inside the building;ï limits activities in the building; andï provides adequate supervision within the building.Liaison with the fire and rescue serviceThe responsible person will need to ensure effective liaison with the fire and rescue service to enable them to carry out firefighting operations. These may include information on:ï the provision of water supplies, seasonal ponds, lakes and underground tanks, and any associated pumps;ï difficult access for fire engines;ï particular hazards in the construction features of the building (including asbestos);ï the use of combustible under floor insulation;ï underground vaults ducts and voids where fire may spread unchecked;ï worn stone slabs in stairway construction; andï the presence of cast iron columns and wrought iron beams.Emergency planningAn important consideration for the owners and trustees is the protection of valuable artefacts and paintings from the effects of fire. However, the efficient evacuation of all occupants must take precedence over procedures for limiting damage to property and contents. Salvage work should be limited to those parts of the building not directly affected by the fire.
Fire wardens and others tasked with carrying out salvage work should have received formal training, adequate protection and be fully briefed about the health and safety risk assessment carried out to identify the dangers associated with this activity.

Industry Security NoticeNumber 2022/10Subject:	Clarification on Requirements for Remote Working with MOD MaterialIntroduction1. The UK Defence Supply Base processes a significant amount of MOD material at the OFFICIAL classification level.2. This ISN provides clarification in respect of how to work on such material when working remotely, for instance when dealing with COVID-19 travel restrictions.Issue3. The typical requirements placed on the Defence Supply Base for protection of MOD material assume a situation where a majority of staff needing access are on premises, with remote working normally being handled on an exception basis.4. This clarification provides generic requirements for Remote Working with MOD Material.1. 
Action by Industry5. Members of the UK Defence Supply Base needing to support Remote Working shall follow the additional stipulations below, in respect of:ï Remote Working Practicesï Discussion of MOD Informationï Securing MOD Informationï Physical Site Securityï Security Breaches6. Remote Working Practices. Existing mandatory security practices shall be followed when handling MOD information classified at SECRET and above, in accordance with the Security Aspect Letter (SAL).7. When handling MOD information classified as OFFICIAL, or OFFICIAL with need-to- know restrictions (for example, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE), this shall:i. follow the current company processes for approval of remote working;ii. only be on company issued and managed devices, systems and/or services within the UK, unless export and accreditation approval have been obtained;iii. only use a secure WiFi connection that is password protected;iv. use a VPN (where appropriate), in line with company profile.8. MOD information shall not be under-classified so that it can be worked on remotely.9. Personal devices and/or accounts shall not be used to handle MOD information, this includes forwarding work email containing MOD information to personal email accounts.10. Discussing MOD Information. MOD Information classified at OFFICIAL and/or OFFICIAL with need-to-know restrictions (for example OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE) may be discussed in the UK using the PSTN, mobile phones and VOIP (for example Skype).11. When discussing MOD Information classified at OFFICIAL and/or OFFICIAL with need-to-know restrictions, the following criteria shall be met:1. 
a. Conversations are only held with key parties, for which a direct/indirectcontractual relationship exists (covered by an associated SAL or equivalent) and the recipient(s):i. hold(s) a sufficient level of clearance for the information being discussed;ii. has (have) a confirmed need-to-know requirement for the information being discussed.iii. are informed of any additional procedural measures, for the safeguarding of the information, the recipient is informed at the beginning of the conversation.b. Conversations conducted using VOIP are performed using an application approved by the company.c. Conversations:i. are not conducted in a public location or in a location where it could be overheard;ii. are conducted using headphones, where necessary to enforce any need- to-know requirements;iii. are not conducted in the vicinity of smart home speakers or devices (for example, Amazon Echo, Google Home and Smart TVs). Where this is unavoidable, ensure the devices are disconnected or switched off prior to all conversations.d. Where there are multiple participants in a ‘virtual meeting’, it is the meeting organiser’s responsibility to confirm only authorised individuals are present on the call.12. Securing MOD Information. All MOD information shall be handled in accordance with the SAL (or equivalent document), this includes:a. adhering to any handling instructions or need-to-know restrictions;b. minimising the amount of hardcopy produced, with the presumption of material being read on screen preferentially;c. protecting of all MOD information in accordance with company policy, and in particular avoiding placing un-shredded material in household waste.a. 
13. To ensure the protection of MOD information whilst travelling:a. company device encryption must be enabled, for example: by powering off/shutting down the device;b. any secure token associated with the company device must be carried separately, for example: not in the same bag/case as the device;c. devices (e.g. laptops) should be carried in line with company policy;d. all hardcopy OFFICIAL information assets should be placed in a single covered opaque envelope (with no GSC marking) or folder and placed within a bag/case;e. all MOD information assets classified as OFFICIAL with need-to-knowrestrictions (for example: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE), should not, for any period of time, be:i. opened/accessed/viewed in a public area;ii. left unattended for any period of time, for example: hotel, restaurant, taxi, public service vehicle, railway carriage; and/oriii. left in an unattended motor vehicle.14. To ensure the protection of MOD information whilst remote working:a. Care must be taken to not draw attention to the fact that MOD information is being worked on;b. MOD information shall be viewed only in a way that it cannot be overseen by people who are not authorised. This can be achieved by making sure:i. the area used minimises overlooking and unexpected interruptions from people;ii. a clear desk policy is implemented;iii. devices are locked, or shut down when leaving it unattended for any period of time;iv. devices and document hardcopies are not to be entrusted to the custody of a member of the public who does not hold a security clearance, for example, left with a house/flat co-resident.c. devices holding MOD information and/or MOD information assets shall be stored in a secure location, for example: a cabinet/cupboard/drawer (preferable lockable). Where this is not possible, then a location that is concealed or not obvious shall be used, and if possible devices should be physically secured, for example by using a ‘laptop lock/cable’;a. 
d. all MOD information assets classified as OFFICIAL with need-to-knowrestrictions (for example: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE) in digital forms shall be protected by encryption;e. all MOD information assets and MOD or company devices (provided to you for purposes of remote working) shall be returned to the company and/or MOD onceremote working has ceased or disposed of in accordance with MOD and company policy.15. Physical Site Security. Whilst the majority of the workforce may be remote working, it is important to ensure premises physical security controls shall be maintained.16. Security Breaches. All confirmed or suspected breaches involving MOD information shall be accurately and quickly reported to your Security Officer, in line with your company procedures, for onward transmission as necessary to DefInd WARP. The report should include details of quantities, location(s), and any handling instructions or need-to-knowrestrictions.Validity / Expiry Date17.

CollectionAI cyber securityA collection of policy documents andresearch papers support the government's work to address cyber security risks to artificial intelligence (AI).From: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology  (/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology) Published 31 January 2025Last updated 10 March 2025 —Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a transformative impact on organisations and public services, but it is vital efforts are taken to protect AI systems from growing cyber security threats. The government is therefore taking steps to address the cyber security risks to AI.Following the National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) Guidelines for secure AI system development (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/guidelines-secure-ai-  system-development), a Call for Views (https://www.gov.uk/government/calls-for-evidence/cyber- security-of-ai-a-call-for-views) and the publication of various research, the government is now publishing a world leading voluntary Code of Practice (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-cyber-security- code-of-practice) which will be used as the basis for a new global standard.
From securing AI systems against hacking and sabotage, to ensuring they are developed and deployed in a secure way, the Code and future standard will help developers and system operators to build secure, innovative AI products that drive growth and support the Plan for Change. This will help give confidence to organisations in adopting the technology which will enhance public services and productivity and increase growth across the economy.An overarching theme that arose from responses to the Call for Views was that organisations would benefit from additional guidance that explained how to implement the Code of Practice. The Government has therefore published an implementation guide to support organisations.DSIT, in close collaboration with NCSC, will be working within the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to develop a global standard and accompanying guide. We will also be engaging with organisations across different sectors of the economy to support their adoption of the security requirements and to encourage participation in the standards development process. This work forms part of DSIT’s wider technology security programme and its secure by design approach across all digital technologies. Further information on how this work links with DSIT’s other cyber security codes can be found here (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-security- codes-of-practice).Policy documentsAI Cyber Security Code of Practice(/g overnment/publications/ai-cyber-security-code-of-practice)	31 January 2025	Policy paperWorld-leading AI cyber security standard to protect digital economy and deliver Plan for Change(/g overnment/news/world-leading-ai-cyber-security-standard-to- protect-digital-economy-and-deliver-plan-for-change)31 January 2025	Press release

1. Executive summaryIntroductionThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) commissioned IFF Research to conduct a survey of businesses in key sectors to understand how they use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how businesses implement cyber security practices and processes around the AI technology they deploy.The quantitative survey was developed in collaboration with DSIT. Fieldwork was conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and took place between 10th January and 13th February 2024. A total of 350 interviews were completed with businesses currently using or considering using AI in nine sectors (see page 6 for more details) so that the survey had a robust number of participants.The core objectives of the research were to understand:  What types of technology are being used, and for what purpose; Businesses’ cyber security practices – in general terms, and specific to AI;  Businesses’ future plans in relation to AI and cyber security; and How these activities and attitudes vary across businesses in different sectors and of different sizes.A glossary which includes definitions of the different types of AI can be found in the Appendix at the end of this report.Key findingsThe survey sought to create a robust sample base of businesses that were adopting at least one AI technology as well as businesses that planned to adopt AI in the future to ensure robust findings could be drawn. 68% of these businesses in the survey were currently using at least one AI technology, while 32% had plans to adopt AI in the future. Of the businesses currently using AI, 64% were deploying one type of AI technology, 22% were using two types of AI and 14% were using three or more.
was most common with 38% of businesses deploying it. 27% utilised machine learning, 25% used computer vision, image processing and generation, 9% used hardware related to AI and 8% used robotic process automation.For each type of AI technology, over half of businesses have been using it for at least one year. In the case of machine learning, over half of businesses (52%) have been using it for over 3 years. Among those who have not yet deployed AI but have plans to do so, they most commonly planned to do this – across all AI technologies – in more than a year’s time.Each AI technology was most commonly adopted through the purchase of external software or ready-to-use systems (ranging from 38% to 60%). Around one in five businesses developed machine learning (21%) and hardware related to AI (19%) in-house. AI development most likely to be outsourced was for hardware related to AI (34%). The main reason cited for using AI technologies was financial or cost savings to their business (35%). 14% employed it to help write documents. 13% cited speed and efficiency purposes, and a further 12% used it for content generation more broadly.Of those currently using AI technologies, nearly half of respondents (47%) had no specific cyber security practices in place specifically for AI and 13% were unsure. Among those planning to use AI in the future, 25% said that their organisation would not have specific cyber security practices or processes in place explicitly regarding the AI technology, once the planned technologies were deployed, and a further 25% were unsure.Of those without or not intending to have specific AI cyber security practices or processes, there were a few key reasons as to why they had not adopted specific practices. 14% had not considered it or did not know enough about it, and 14% said they do not use AI for anything sensitive.The survey also asked participants whether there were specific cyber security requirements or features that they expect to be built into AI companies’ models and systems. 39% of respondents stated no and a significant minority (33%) were unsure.When asked more generally about cyber security practices, 90% of all businesses had at least one governance or risk management arrangement in place. Just under three-quarters (72%) had a formal policy or policies in place covering cyber security risks, and around two-thirds had either a Business Continuity Plan that covers cyber security (67%), or a written list of the most critical data, systems or assets that their organisation wants to protect (64%).Over the last 12 months, just over three-quarters (78%) of businesses had taken at least one measure in an effort to identify cyber security risk. The most common measures taken by organisations were to conduct a risk assessment
covering cyber security risk (59%), or to invest in specific tools designed for security monitoring, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (55%).2. IntroductionBackgroundThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) commissioned IFF Research to conduct a survey to understand how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used by businesses in key sectors and how businesses implement cyber security practices and processes around the AI technology they deploy.Artificial intelligence is the broader field encompassing knowledge-based systems, data-driven and machine learning-enabled systems, including classic machine learning (supervised learning, unsupervised learning), deep learning, and reinforcement learning, referring to the development of systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence. The use of AI is growing. In April 2023, an estimated 16% of all UK businesses had adopted at least one AI technology[footnote 1] and with the growth of more accessible and powerful generative AI models, this number is likely to increase significantly. The growing use of AI among businesses presents huge opportunities; however, without appropriate safeguards there are also significant risks. This is particularly the case with cyber security which is an essential precondition for the safety of AI systems. It was in this context that DSIT commissioned IFF Research to carry out primary research among UK businesses.Research objectivesThe core objectives of the research were to understand:What types of technology are being used, and for what purpose; Businesses’ cyber security practices – in general terms, and specific to AI; Businesses’ future plans in relation to AI and cyber security; andHow these activities and attitudes vary across businesses in different sectors
A glossary which includes definitions of the different types of AI can be found in the Appendix at the end of this report.Survey fieldworkThis report is based on data from a quantitative telephone survey comprising of 350 interviews conducted between January and February 2024 with UK businesses currently using or considering using AI in the following sectors: D,E,H: Electricity, Gas and Air Conditioning Supply; Water Supply; Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities; Transportation and Storage C: Manufacturing  G: Wholesale and Retail Trade J: Information and Communication K: Financial and Insurance Activities M: Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities  Q: Human Health and Social Work Activities3. MethodologyA quantitative survey was developed in collaboration with DSIT and refined during a pilot fieldwork phase (full details of the methodology are included in the accompanying technical report). Interviews lasted an average of 15 minutes and fieldwork was conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) between 10th January and 13th February 2024 (inclusive of the pilot fieldwork phase). The interviewing team asked to speak to the person responsible for cyber security within the organisation.Participants interviewed held a range of roles, often within the remit of IT or operations, such as: Head of IT, IT director / manager, Operations director / manager, Business development manager, and Office manager.
This research sought to interview a total of 350 UK businesses, split equally among seven (grouped) sectors as shown in Table 3.1. The sectors were chosen by mapping SIC sectors where AI uptake is likely to be high, alongside Critical National Infrastructure sectors where the largest societal impacts from the exploitation of cyber security vulnerabilities are likely to exist.Table 3.1 Interview targets by sectorSector	TargetD, E, H: Electricity, Gas and Air Conditioning Supply; Water Supply;	50Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities; Transportation and StorageC: Manufacturing	50G: Wholesale and Retail Trade	50J: Information and Communication	50K: Financial and Insurance Activities	50M: Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities	50Q: Human Health and Social Work Activities	50SampleThe sample for the survey was sourced from Market Location, a commercial database of UK businesses. The survey sought to create a robust sample base of businesses that were adopting at least one AI technology as well as businesses that planned to adopt AI in the future to ensure robust findings could be drawn. It was not possible to know at the point of drawing sample whether or not businesses were in-scope for the survey, therefore it was necessary to screen for this with a question at the point of recruitment.

A call outcome is defined as a definite response to the survey invitation, i.e. whether an interview was achieved, or whether an interview could not be achieved and the reason was established. Among the 10,924 businesses called at least once, the response rate for the survey was 3% (shown in Table 3.3). This included businesses where no final outcome was reached, for example where the interviewing team were not able to get through to the right person, where an appointment had been made to call back at a later date, or where a or where the call went to answerphone. Among the 2,193 businesses where a definite call outcome was achieved, the response rate was 16% (shown in Table 3.4).10% of businesses screened out because they confirmed their organisation does not use AI and is not considering deploying it in the future. However, this proportion increases to 48% when based on records where a definitive outcome was reached. The high proportion of businesses screening out and subsequent lower response rate was expected due to the specific eligibility requirement of businesses needing to be using or have plans to use AI.Table 3.3 Unadjusted response rateDescriptionNumber%Total records called at least once10,924100%Completed3503%Screen out - Organisation does not use AI and is not considering deploying AI in the future1,05910%Respondent refusal4864%Respondent unavailable during fieldwork2342%Contact made – no definite outcome2,70725%No direct contact made with respondent5,05646%Over quota641%Unobtainable (e.g. wrong number, out of service)9689%

These businesses as a proportion of all those for whom we have a definite answer on whether or not they use AI, equates to 21%. This is slightly higher than the ONS finding in April 2023 which reported an estimated 16% of all UK businesses had adopted at least one AI technology.[footnote 2]Reasons for not using AIRespondents who confirmed during the survey that they do not use, or have plans to use, any Artificial Intelligence tools within the business were asked what has prevented their organisation from implementing AI technologies.Among the 193 businesses who answered, the most common reason provided was that they have not identified a need for AI, including deeming it irrelevant for their sector or industry (44%). One in ten said they have not thought about AI or do not know enough about it (10%) and they have no interest in it, for example preferring human interaction (9%). 8% deemed AI unnecessary due to the small size of their business, 6% said they lack the time or resources to set it up and 6% had concerns about the security of AI models and systems, including data security and confidentiality.
Data analysis and weightingLarge and medium-sized businesses are over-represented in this survey compared to the business population. This was a deliberate decision - the Department needed a good-sized sample base of these types of businesses. Weighting by size and sector was therefore considered. However, as the number of interviews is small, the weights were deemed too large to apply and would have had a considerable negative impact on the effective base size. Specifically, it would have meant that it would not be possible to report the findings of businesses of a particular size or sector. These survey results cannot therefore be considered representative of the business population, however, can still provide useful insight into the behaviour of businesses that took part.4. AI usageThis chapter explores: the types of AI used by organisations;  how long they have been using them;  how the AI was adopted; and reasons for employing AI technologyTypes of AI usedOverall, 68% of businesses were currently using at least one AI technology, while the remaining 32% had plans to adopt AI in the future. Figure 4.1 illustrates the type of AI technologies currently used and planned within these businesses. Natural language processing and generation was most commonly used, with 38% of businesses currently using this type of AI, and a further 27% planning to deploy it in the future. Those in the Information and Communication sector were most likely to be currently using this type of AI (54%).Businesses in Human Health and Social Work Activities were more likely than businesses overall to be currently using computer vision, image processing and generation (42% compared to 25% overall). Businesses in this sector were also more likely to be currently using hardware related to AI (19% compared to 9% overall). The use of robotic process automation was significantly higher among
large businesses (23% compared to 8% overall).Figure 4.1 Use of AI technologiesSource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Question B1. For the following Artificial Intelligence technologies, please could you tell me whether your organisation is currently using it (including piloting), not currently but have plans to adopt in the future, or has no plans to use it. Base: All (350)Of the businesses currently using AI, 64% were deploying one type of AI technology, 22% were using two types of AI, and 14% were using three or more. Meanwhile, among businesses planning to adopt AI in the future, 43% planned to introduce one type of AI, 26% planned to introduce two types of AI and 31% planned to introduce three or more.Figure 4.2 Number of AI technologies businesses use or plan to useSource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Count of AI technologies from B1. Base: Those currently using AI (239) and Those not using AI but plan to in the future (111)Those currently using AI were asked what specific AI products they were using. The most common product was ChatGPT (38%) followed by:  15% - AI with hardware and physical products; 8% - AI tools within Microsoft office (exc. co-pilot);  5% - Microsoft Co-pilot; 5% - Gemini (formerly Google Bard);  5% - Sage; 4% - AI tool within Adobe creative suite; and  3% - Xero.The remaining AI products currently used were mentioned by 2% of businesses or less. Where there were single mentions of products, these remained categorised as “other” in the dataset. 9% of businesses currently deploying AI were unable to name the specific product.Length of time using AIFor each type of AI technology, over half of businesses have been using it for at
least one year. Over half of businesses (52%) using AI within machine learning have been doing so for over 3 years.Figure 4.3 Length of time using each AI technologySource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Caution * denotes low base size. Question B2. Please could you tell me whether your organisation is currently piloting the following technology, has used for 1-3 years, or has used for over 3 years. Base: Those currently using AI (239); RPA (27) *, machine learning (94), Hardware related to AI (32) *, Computer vision/ image processing and generation (88) and Natural language processing and generation (132).Among those who have not yet deployed AI but have plans to do so, they most commonly planned to do this in more than a year’s time. This is true across the different AI technologies, as shown in Figure 4.4. Natural language processing and generation (18%) and computer vision, image processing and generation (17%) were most likely to be adopted in the next year.A notable number of records were ‘back-coded’ post-fieldwork. This is where respondents initially said they did not use the AI technologies listed but instead used an alternative technology and as such were not asked this question. Post fieldwork, these ‘other’ technologies were reviewed and found to all fall into these five categories of AI and were subsequently back-coded into the appropriate technology.Figure 4.4 When organisations not currently using AI plan to adopt itSource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Question B3. Please could you tell me whether your organisation is planning to adopt the following technology in the next year or whether you plan to adopt it further in the future. Base: Those not using AI but plan to (111); Natural language processing and generation (94), Computer vision/ image processing and generation (69), Hardware related to AI (52), machine learning (98) and RPA (56).How the AI was adoptedEach AI technology was most commonly adopted through the purchase of external software or ready-to-use systems, shown in Figure 4.5. Around one in five businesses developed machine learning (21%) and hardware related to AI (19%) in-house. AI development most likely to be outsourced was for hardware related to AI (34%).
language processing and generation (5% vs 14% among businesses overall) and more likely to purchase external software or ready-to-use systems for computer vision, image processing and generation (78% vs 60% among businesses overall).Figure 4.5 How the AI technology was adoptedSource: AI Cyber Security Survey Caution * denotes low base size. Question B4. How did your organisation adopt the following technology: [Technology].Base: Those currently using AI (239); machine learning (94), Hardware related to AI (32) *, Computer vision/ image processing and generation (88), RPA (27) * and Natural language processing and generation (132).Reasons for employing AI technologyJust over a third of businesses currently using AI said they did this for the purpose of financial or cost savings to their business (35%). Those that said they had cyber security practices in place explicitly for current AI technologies were more likely to report using AI for financial or cost savings compared to those without such practices in place (42% vs 29%). 14% employed AI to help write documents, 13% cited speed and efficiency purposes, and a further 12% used it for content generation more broadly. 8% reported using AI to improve quality or enhance their product offering.Figure 4.6 Reasons for employing AI technologySource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Question B5. For what reasons does your organisation employ AI technology? Base: Those currently using AI (239)5. Cyber security practices around AIThis chapter explores organisations’ cyber security practices surrounding AI technologies they deploy.Cyber security practices explicitly regarding AIOf those currently using AI technologies, as shown in Figure 5.1, two-fifths (40%)
said they had specific cyber security practices or processes in place explicitly regarding the AI technology they deploy. Just under one-half (47%) said they did not have such practices in place specifically for AI, and 13% were unsure.Micro businesses and organisations using only one AI technology were less likely to have cyber security practices in place in relation to the AI technology they deploy (31% and 35% respectively). Similarly, those who had purchased off- the-shelf AI products were less likely to have specific practices in place (31%), while those who had outsourced the development of AI were considerably more likely to have practices in place (63%).[footnote 3] Businesses that developed the AI technologies in-house were neither more or less likely to have specific cyber security practices or processes in place compared to businesses overall.Among those planning to use AI in the future, half (50%) said that their organisation would have specific cyber security practices or processes in place explicitly regarding the AI technology once the planned technologies were deployed. Meanwhile, 25% said that they would not have such practices and 25% were unsure.Figure 5.1 Whether organisations have, or plan to have, specific cyber security practices in place explicitly regarding AI technologySource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Question C1. Does your organisation have specific cyber security practices or processes in place explicitly regarding the AI technology you deploy? Base: Those currently using AI technologies (239).Question C2. Would your organisation have specific cyber security practices or processes in place explicitly regarding the AI technology once your planned AI technologies are deployed? Base: Those planning on using AI technology (111)Of those with or intending to have specific AI cyber security practices or processes, just over a quarter mentioned deploying firewalls for AI (27%). One- fifth of organisations reported ensuring personal data is not shared with third parties (19%). As shown in Figure 5.2, just under a third (29%) did not know what exactly these cyber security practices were or would be. Although participants said they were the appropriate person to discuss cyber security, some of those interviewed were not in an IT role and therefore could be why they were unsure of the specific practices and processes in place.Figure 5.2 Cyber security processes explicitly regarding AI technologies currently deployed or that businesses plan to deploySource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Question C3. Please could you summarise what these practices or processes are/might be? Base: Those with or intending to have specific AI cyber security practices or processes (150).
processes, there were a few key reasons as to why they had not adopted specific practices. 14% had not considered it or did not believe they know enough about it, and 14% said they do not use AI for anything sensitive (and therefore deemed it unnecessary). Around one in ten said AI is not widely used enough to warrant specific measures (11%) and that it falls within their general cyber security practices anyway (10%). Those who purchased of off-the-shelf products were more likely to say AI is not widely used enough to warrant specific cyber security measures (18% vs 11% overall).Two-fifths (39%) of all businesses that took part in the survey said that there were not any specific cyber security requirements or features that they expect to be built into AI companies’ models and systems, and a further third (33%) were unsure. One in ten (11%) said that they would expect data protection and privacy to be built in, rising to 23% among large organisations, and 17% among those who purchased off-the-shelf AI tools. Others mentioned higher levels of security (3%), ensuring data sources are legal and reliable (2%) and protection against hacking/cyber-attacks (2%). 3% said security is already built into the AI system. Micro organisations were more likely to say that there were not any specific cyber requirements they would expect to be built into AI companies’ models and systems (47% vs 39% overall).Of those organisations that outsourced the development of their AI technology, 81% said they had not identified a vulnerability or been breached as a result of the AI service deployed in their infrastructure. 11% had identified a vulnerability but not been breached, while 4% had experienced a breach. There was no significant variation across subgroups.6. General cyber security practicesThis final chapter explores general cyber security practices. As stated to organisations that took part in the survey, this means any strategy, processes, practices or technologies that organisations have in place to secure their networks, computers, programs or the data they hold from damage, attack or unauthorised access.General cyber security practicesWhen asked more generally about cyber security practices, 90% of all businesses had at least one governance or risk management arrangement in place. Just under three-quarters (72%) had a formal policy or policies in place
covering cyber security risks, and around two-thirds had either a Business Continuity Plan that covers cyber security (67%), or a written list of the most critical data, systems or assets that their organisation wants to protect (64%).As shown Figure 6.1, findings varied considerably by the size of the organisation. Large businesses were more likely to have all three of these arrangements in place (88%, 93% and 81% respectively). Micro businesses on the other hand tended to be less likely to have one of these arrangements in place, with 15% stating that they had none of them at all. 7% of all businesses had none of the risk management arrangements listed, and 3% said they were unsure.There were also some differences by sector. A formal policy or policies in place covering cyber security risks was most common among those in Human Health and Social Work Activities (85%). A Business Continuity Plan that covers cyber security was most common among those in Financial and Insurance Activities (85%). An outsourced provider that manages their cyber security was most prevalent in the sector group consisting of Electricity, Gas and Air Conditioning Supply; Water Supply; Sewerage, Waste Management and Remediation Activities; and Transportation and Storage (72%), as well as those in Financial and Insurance Activities (72%). Organisations in the Information and Communication sector and Financial and Insurance Activities were most likely to have board members with responsibility for cyber security (69% and 72% respectively).Those with cyber security practices in place explicitly for AI technologies were more likely to have: An outsourced provider that manages their cyber security (67% vs 58% overall); A formal policy or policies in place covering cyber security risks (87% vs 72% overall); A Business Continuity Plan that covers cyber security (83% vs 67% overall); and A written list of the most critical data, systems or assets that their organisation wants to protect (75% vs 64% overall).Figure 6.1 Governance or risk management arrangements currently in placeSource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Question D1. Which of the following governance or risk management arrangements, if any, do you have in place? Base: All (350).When asked about specific cyber security standards or accreditations, as shown
in Figure 6.2, 34% of organisations said they adhered to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This compares to 27% of businesses in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2023.[footnote 4] Around three in ten (29%) adhered to the Cyber Essentials standard, and a further 12% followed the Cyber Essentials Plus standard (compared to 5% and 2% respectively in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey). Just under one-fifth (18%) conformed to the ISO 27000 Standard (compared to 9% of businesses that adhered to the ISO 27001 in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey), and 14% followed any National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards (compared to 3% of businesses that adhered to the ISO 27001 in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey). Around one-quarter of organisations were not adhering to any of these standards (26%), and 14% were unaware.Figure 6.2 Standards or accreditations adhered to by organisationsSource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Question D2. Which of the following standards or accreditations, if any, does your organisation adhere to? Base: All (350)The Cyber Essentials standard was more likely to be adhered to by large and medium-sized businesses (49% and 44% respectively), and those in the Information and Communication sector (46%).The Cyber Essentials Plus standard was more likely to be adhered to by medium-sized businesses and those in the Information and Communication sector (25% and 23% respectively).Any National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards were more likely to be adhered to by large businesses (33%).The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard was more likely to be adhered to by those in the Wholesale and Retail sector (49%) and the ISO 27000 Standard was more likely to be adhered to by those in the Information and Communication sector (31%).Meanwhile, micro businesses and those in the Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities sector were more likely to not adhere to any of these standards (40% and 42% respectively).Over the last 12 months, just over three-quarters (78%) of businesses had taken at least one of the measures listed in Figure 6.3 in an effort to identify cyber security risk. This compares to 51% of businesses that had taken at least one measure in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2023.[footnote 5] The mostcommon measures taken by organisations were to conduct a risk assessment covering cyber security risk (59%, compared to 29% of businesses in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey), or to invest in specific tools designed for security
monitoring, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (55%, compared to 30% of businesses in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey). Those in the Financial and Insurance Activities sector were most likely to have conducted a risk assessment covering cyber security risks (74%) and those in the Information and Communication sector were most likely to have used specific tools designed for security monitoring (75%).Just under half (48%) had conducted a cyber security vulnerability audit (compared to 15% of businesses in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey), rising to 65% of businesses in the Information and Communication sector, and 64% of those in the Financial and Insurance Activities sector.Two-fifths (40%) had tested staff awareness, for example via mock phishing exercises. This compares to 19% of businesses in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey. A third of businesses (33%) had carried out penetration testing, compared to 11% of businesses in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey. Around a quarter of businesses (24%) had used or invested in threat intelligence, compared to 9% of businesses in the Cyber Security Breaches Survey.Large businesses were more likely to have taken any of the measures listed in Figure 6.3 than the average across businesses of less than 250 employees.15% of businesses had taken none of the measures listed in the survey to identify cyber security risks to their organisation, rising to one-quarter (25%) among micro businesses. 7% were unaware if their organisation had undertaken any of these activities.Figure 6.3 Actions taken to identify cyber security risks over the last 12 monthsSource: AI Cyber Security Survey. Question D3. Which of the following, if any, have you done over the last 12 months to identify cyber security risks to your organisation? Base: All (350)7.

Executivesummary
regulation that enable themA National AI Strategy is needed to prioritise and set a time frame that will position the UK for success

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in people’s lives, the UK finds itself at a pivotal moment.Estimates show that AI could deliver a 10% increase in UK GDP in 2030.1 If approached correctly, this would offer huge benefits to the economy, to recovery and resilience, the environment and for people from all walks of life across all parts of the UK. This summary report by the AI Council sets out long- term ambitions and suggests near-term directions for all government departments, with the aim of cementing the UK as one of the very best places in the world to live with, work with and develop AI.The UK starts from a place of strength in research, enterprise and regulation, and with its history of recent support for AI it stands among the best in the world. The UK government’s ambition should push
for scale and reliability in areas of unique advantage. To be influential in attracting talent, shaping global markets and global governance we call on the government to build a UK National AI strategy that scales up its investment for a decade and beyond.This report has two underlying messages. The first is that we need to “double down” on recent investment the UK has made in AI. The second message is that we must look to the horizon and be adaptable to disruption. Support for AI needs to reflect the rapid pace and evolution of the science & technology and its applications. This means staying at the forefront of the development of AI and integrating approaches to ethics, security and social impacts and planning for the next 10-50 years. The UK will only feel the full benefits of AI if all parts of society have full confidence in the science and the technologies, and in the governance and
regulation that enable them. That confidence will depend on the existence of systems that ensure full accountability, clear ethics and transparency. Developing the best science and the most robust applications requires commitment to an ambitious programme of investment in talent; one that promotes cutting edge skills and does so in ways that makes AI accessible in ways that are more diverse and inclusive.Given the breadth and significance of potential AI applications, this Roadmap is concerned with overcoming the challenges of enabling change. It sets out suggested directions across four pillars: Research, Development & Innovation; Skills and Diversity, and Data, Infrastructure and Public Trust - and then, in the final section, addresses some specific measures to support adoption and the key areas of health, climate and defence.
This Roadmap and its recommendations reflects the views of the Council as well as 100+ additional experts. We recognise it will not be possible to achieve all at once, and this is why a National AI Strategy is needed to prioritise and set a time frame that will position the UK for success. In order to support the government, we are ready to convene workshops with the wider ecosystem in order to capture more detail and work together to ensure that a future National AI Strategy enables the whole of the UK to flourish.

16 recommendations to help thegovernment develop a UK National AI Strategy
Research, Development and Innovation
Skills and Diversity	Data, Infrastructure and Public Trust
National, Cross-sector Adoption

1. Scale up and make sustainable public sector investment in AI; ensure consistent access to top talent from around the world; and find new ways to bring researchers, disciplines and sectors together. Build on the commitments in the government’s R&D Roadmap2 and suggestions in the soon to be published UKRI AI review3.2. Cement The Alan Turing Institute as a truly national institute, with a set of regional investments that draw on strengths from across the UK.Provide assured long term public sector funding that will give the Turing and others the confidence to plan and invest in strategic leadership for the UK in AI research, development and innovation.3. Ensure moonshots, as described in the R&D Roadmap as challenge-led, high-risk, scalable programmes, are both advancing and leveraging AI. These could tackle fundamental challenges such as creating “explainable AI”, or important goals in any area where AI can contribute strongly, such as the UK Digital Twin program or developing smart materials for energy storage in the move towards Net Zero carbon emissions.4. 
Scale up and commit to an ongoing 10 year programme of high level AI skill- building. This would include research fellowships, AI-relevant PhDs across disciplines, industry-led Masters and level 7 apprenticeships.5. Make diversity and inclusion a priority. We suggest benchmarking and forensically tracking levels of diversity to make data-led decisions about where to invest and ensure that underrepresented groups are given equal opportunity and included in all programs.6. Commit to achieving AI and data literacy for everyone. The public needs to understand the risks and rewards of AI so they can be confident and informed users. An online academy for understanding AI, with trusted materials and initiatives would support teachers, school students and lifelong learning.7. 
Consolidate and accelerate the infrastructure needed to increase access to data for AI. Invest in the relevant organisations, link general principles to specific applications, and pursue initiatives for pump priming innovation and enabling safe data sharing for valuable uses.8. Lead the development of data governance options and its uses. The UK should lead in developing appropriate standards to frame the future governance of data.9. Ensure public trust through public scrutiny. The UK must lead in finding ways to enable public scrutiny of, and input to, automated decision-making and help ensure that the public can trust AI.10. Thoughtfully position the UK with respect to other major AI nations. Building on its strengths, the UK has a crucial opportunity to become a global lead in good governance, standards and frameworks for AI and enhance bilateral cooperation with key actors.11. 
Increase buyer confidence and AI capability across all sectors and all sizes of company. Support investment for local initiatives to enable safe value- creating innovation and improve the data maturity needed for AI innovation.12. Support the UK’s AI startup vendor community.

2 UK Research and Development Roadmap, UK Government ( July 2020)3 [To be published early 2021]1 

Introduction
an essential part of tackling the major challenges of economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, of levelling up the UK economy through the creation of jobs and prosperity beyond London and the South East, of ensuring new forms of health and social care, of reaching net zero carbon emissions, and of ensuring resilience to future economic, health, or environmental shocks. It will also create entirely new opportunities for human flourishing.These fundamental strengths and recent initiatives have helped the UK to be amongst the global leaders in many areas
coming five years to open 12 new institutes that will keep the country at the forefront of research in AI and quantum computing9, and like-minded countries such as Canada and Germany are leading on commercialisation as measured by patents.10The Council calls for a UK National AI Strategy that creates an even stronger general base of support for AI. Scotland has already embarked on an AI Strategy and the UK strategy should be created in consultation with the devolved administrations and the wider ecosystem.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is breaking into the mainstream of societies and the global economy.The history of AI is characterised by cycles of boom and bust, with waves of excessive hype followed by “AI winters”. This time things are different: advances in machine learning and neural networks have led to great advances in fields such as computer vision and speech recognition, and natural language processing, with numerous applications used by hundreds of millions of people on a daily basis. Safely harnessed AI is revolutionising certain types of tasks, disrupting business models, and complementing and enhancing human capabilities in wholly new ways. These tremendous advances have come from increasing the sizes of training data sets, and the associated networks and
underlying algorithms, many of which have been with us in some form for a long time. This accounts for tens of billions of dollars in global annual value creation, and looks set to increase markedly over the coming decade.4The UK has fundamental strengths in AI which reach back to the intellectual origins of the science, with figures like Alan Turing, Joan Clarke, Donald Michie and many others, to its ability to debate and enact sound governance of new technologies. Successive governments, businesses and civil groups have worked hard to make increasing amounts of data and information more available in ways that combine safety and usefulness.In recent years, the UK has been the site of an array of initiatives aimed at developing and deploying AI across the
of AI, from accelerating drug discovery5 to helping businesses make decisions that accurately factor in climate volatility.6However, the next few months and years will be crucial in determining where the UK places its desired level of ambition in AI, as massive investments by governments and businesses around the world are already priming themselves to influence the global conversation. The scale of effort elsewhere must not be underestimated: Germany has committed €3.1 billion towards a national AI strategy up to 20257, and France has pledged €1.5 billion up to 2022, with almost half earmarked for research.8 While the UK has played a leading role in the development of AI, the US has recently announced $1 billion over the
The UK cannot, and need not try to, compete equally in all economic sectors so it must shape its strategy carefully to ensure it prioritises and is able to act selectively to lead and to capture markets around the world. In doing this it will need to consider its options for collaboration and competition within the international scientific and economic landscapes.
compute power, by factors of a million or more, along with modifications to the
economy for society. Building on these with focus and structure will ensure AI is4 
Some estimates show that leading nations could gain an extra 20-25% in economic growth and productivity gains through AI over the next decade.

The Council has considered how to diffuse the development of AI across sections of society that would help to both improve the lives of its citizens and bring economic benefits in the form of recovery and resilience. This has resulted in four pillars:ï support for research, development and innovation;ï literacy in AI across the population with enhanced AI-related skills at all levels of educational and lifelong attainment;ï sound physical, digital and virtual infrastructure, including robust and flexible regulation as a form of social infrastructure, resulting in good governance that boosts public trust;ï and pragmatic approaches to national, cross-sector adoption that meaningfully advances public and private sector applications.This Roadmap sets out the requirements in each of these areas in more detail and builds on the 2017 Hall-Pesenti AI Review. Its premise is that, in most areas, what the UK needs to do is to “double down” on the best of the investments it has already made, and to accelerate what’s proved to be ‘working building’ capability across organisations and sectors. Doing this is not easy, and least of all in the face of jobs at risk that could be made more vulnerable by the twin pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic and automation.12
Fundamentally, it requires commitments of a size, and for sustained timescales, that are often only possible at times of disruption such as the one the world is going through now with its response and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It therefore requires a degree of collective vision and of boldness, combining this leadership with the confidence to create spaces for entrepreneurism in all parts of society and the economy in order to find new ways to use AI to benefit everyone.In a small number of important areas this Roadmap points in new directions. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, developing trustworthy technology is vital and businesses will require a novel approach to good governance and consideration of the ethical and societal implications of AI as part of the design process, with greater multi-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary approaches throughout. The UK needs to develop a world-class enabling environment with strong but flexible legislation and well- resourced, capable regulators able to provide responsive guidance and timely oversight.This Roadmap is not a draft strategy, and nor is it an instruction manual. This is a set of recommendations and we recognise it will not be possible to achieve all at once. This is why a National AI Strategy is needed to prioritise and set a time frame. We are ready to convene workshops across all of the areas laid out in this Roadmap, and more, to capture the full spectrum of thought across the
UK in a way that would lend itself to the development of a UK National AI Strategy. We have set out a clear direction that we believe will accelerate the UK to a positive technological future and start the necessary conversations needed to create a strategy that will enable the whole of the UK to flourish.

1. Research, Development and Innovation
aspiration to be more imaginative in ways of ensuring that research and innovation is directly responsive to the needs and aspirations of society. This last point echoes strongly the views of the AI Council’s ecosystem.In addition to building on these broad directions, there are three areas which are more specific to AI and on which the government needs to take significant action.The Alan Turing Institute: local presences and global reach
Concentrating on these beginnings, an enhanced and reshaped Turing will be a crucial part of the necessary research, development and innovation infrastructure but, to play that role fully, some changes are needed. The UK’s research system as a whole cannot reach its full potential while the original membership model has the effect of inadvertently excluding excellent research teams across the four nations. The UK needs the Turing to have a full national reach so that it can play its part in levelling up and in supporting talent and great ideas wherever they start. To do this, it will need to be able to bring
AI’s full potential will only be realised in the UK if the government continues to create the conditions for leading edge research, development and innovation in AI for the public and private sectors, and if it creates the conditions for AI to work in and with multiple disciplines and areas of society and the economy.In common with some other parts of this Roadmap, what can seem like a restatement of general principles that could be taken for granted is, in fact, a challenging requirement for sustained systemic change.The government’s R&D Roadmap13 makes an excellent start in outlining some of the areas of systemic change that will particularly benefit AI. One of the most important commitments is to make the UK a place that is open and inviting to top talent. Demand for AI talent is at an
all-time high, and there is more to do to attract and retain the very best to the UK’s shores. Skills training, both at a research and workforce level, is vital to translate research, development and innovation, and suggestions are detailed in the forthcoming section.The government R&D Roadmap includes valuable commitments to strengthening the interactions between discovery and applied research, innovation, commercialisation and deployment. This is vital: funding either excellent basic or applied research in isolation risks the outputs and the people being easily transferred to other countries, so any competitive advantage can be easily and quickly lost, especially to other countries that have more resources than the UK. The R&D Roadmap also signifies support for entrepreneurs; creating a more place- based approach to research, development and innovation; and the
The first is to build on the existing success of The Alan Turing Institute as a national champion for AI research, development and innovation in the UK. In a relatively short period of time the Turing has developed to play a pivotal role in promoting AI research across sectors and in attracting talent by leveraging its growing network. Over the past year, the Turing has attracted 77 new Turing Fellows, bringing the total to 369, and 21 new research associates alongside 116 events across their research portfolio, and a student enrichment scheme intake representing 36% female and 32% from BAME backgrounds.14 It has also reached out to crowdsource best practice for data science and AI research, was pivotal in creating a new discipline in data-centric engineering, and has worked across government to provide policy advice and operational support.
together researchers, businesses, civil groups and the public sector to make great ideas work at all geographic levels and at a sector-wide scale.A new Turing model might, for example, extend both its virtual and physical presences to energise more regional and local activity. There are several ways to achieve such aims, building on the Turing’s convening role in the UK landscape to join up and build on existing teams and infrastructure. This could be delivered through Turing acting as a headquarters and convenor of a nationally network of centres-of- excellence or hubs, which may be physical or virtual, which would not only advance AI research but also development, innovation and deployment into the regions. Across these centres, skills training will be at both the research level and, most importantly, in apprenticeships, upskilling and reskilling regional

workforces to exploit the opportunities of AI across sectors of the UK economy.Models for such centres might be based on, for example, UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, or focus on regions to support AI research, development and innovation capability to support the local economy.Well-funded institutes are becoming highly valued components of national AI strategies, and as a national institute of global standing, the Turing also needs the assured long term public sector funding that will give it and others the confidence to plan and invest for the medium term and strategic leadership for the UK, with the needs of academia, businesses, civil groups and the public sector reflected in its strategic direction. A well-funded UK institute would not only signal the UK’s commitment to remaining a globally leading player over the coming decades, it could also promote the UK’s interests through collaborations with international partners and enable it to play a significant role in building the international infrastructure discussed as part of the third pillar in this Roadmap.Sustainable funding would enable the Turing to provide visible national leadership on matters of AI security and ethics, and use this leadership role and connectivity across the landscape to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of next-generation AI developments, such as those involving machine learning from small data sets, and machine learning as part of wholly new types of neural
interface technologies.15 This added focus on how to leap-frog current machine learning-based AI technologies would enable the UK, through the Turing and its network-trusted and neutral status, to also become the place for Explainable AI, bringing us closer to safe, responsible and trustworthy AI.Challenge-led innovationThe significant promise of AI and its high risk, high reward, aspirational nature lends itself to goal-directed “moonshot” programmes in the style often associated with ARPA-esque models.16a Properly designed and delivered moonshot programmes play to AI’s strengths by requiring people to work across boundaries and existing organisational structures, and to build new relationships, networks and common languages in order to develop entirely new solutions to big challenges. In addition to this, there is a need for the UK to consider further the question of how AI interacts with people, and what it means to create effective human-AI partnerships.One such moonshot, directly relevant to AI, might involve a major challenge aimed at developing and establishing appropriate methods for safe, ethical, explainable and reproducible AI which will accelerate its use across many sectors. Another would be the development of an innovation ecosystem enabled by the UK Digital Twin programme, as discussed later in this
Roadmap, within which AI would use these virtual worlds to explore real world optimisations that are beyond human scale.AI should also be built into moonshots in other sectors where it could play a major part, for example to radically accelerate materials science to develop new materials that can better store energy from renewable sources, or in solving for real-time control of the increasingly complex electricity distribution network as the country moves towards net zero emissions.Across all the potential types of challenge- based funding, programmes need to be selected and designed to draw in and accelerate AI’s integration across disciplines and sectors. One suggestion would be to select broad sectors that are more mature, and thus ripe for AI adoption than others, and use the mission-based approach to focus minds. This would bring together basic and applied research and multiple disciplines across research horizons and opportunities for systems development, helping to mature AI as a discipline.The specific vehicle for delivering moonshots is a ripe topic for discussion, but a forward-looking framework for research, development and innovation consisting of a series of labs, which conceive of and build fully engineered prototypes and platforms, could offer a flexible model of experimentation. These labs could generate vision-based
sequences of projects around moonshot challenges and could serve those with an interest in working between industry, academia and the public sector.By providing significant signals about potential future developments, moonshots create space for informed public and business engagement with the emerging science and applications. Under these circumstances the science and technology is not simply communicated to; it is inspired by, and carried out with, individuals, communities and businesses. Such space enables all those involved to explore how AI interacts with people and what it means to create human-AI partnerships. In turn, the projects will help define responsible and ethical practices to meet society’s needs and aspirations for a technology that behaves as people and businesses hope and expect: safely, securely and reliably.
15 iHuman perspective: Neural interfaces, The Royal Society (September 2019)16a The US’ Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) is a model designed to concentrate funding around pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies, often for national security purposes. DARPA (for Defense) is the most well-known ARPA agency in the US and is credited with developing a number of disruptive technologies such as stealth technology, the foundations of the Internet, and miniature GPS receivers.

AI to transform research, development and innovationCapitalising on the promise of AI will continue to require investment in basic research into the fundamentals of AI itself. Researchers, increasingly working across disciplines, will need to address some of the fundamental challenges that remain, such as establishing a common language through which to develop data science projects or interoperability between datasets, which can drive smart collaboration. AI systems often rely on a narrow disciplinary base, and this needs to be broadened to cover an array of domains in an intelligent way. AI technologies need to get better at extending into areas where they do not have structured data, and to navigate effectively through that.At the same time AI is transforming the nature of research itself, with examples in particle physics and bioinformatics.16b For the UK to retain its status as a global leader in research, it needs to stay well abreast of the potentially disruptive effects of AI and other forms of data science which are beginning to be incorporated into all forms of knowledge creation, including the social sciences and the humanities. Given the availability of massive data sets and computer power, such disruptions could range from game-changing increases in efficiency in routine tasks such as searching texts or large observational data sets, to entirely new forms of enquiry brought about by AI’s ability to
spot new patterns and prompt new questions and insights, often across existing disciplinary boundaries.

2. Skills and Diversity
about ethics. It is about knowing enough to be a conscious and confident user of AI-related products; to know what questions to ask, what risks to look out for, what ethical and societal implications might arise, and what kinds of opportunities AI might provide. Without a basic literacy in AI specifically, the UK will miss out on opportunities created by AI applications, and will be vulnerable to poor consumer and public decision- making, and the dangers of over- persuasive hype or misplaced fear.Over time, AI needs to be built into the curriculum as a specialist subject. As well
demand to justify a five to tenfold increase in places compared to the numbers in the AI Review.To ensure a steady supply of skilled entrants to the workforce, and to send the right signals to young people making further academic choices, the UK should commit to scaling up its programmes significantly at all levels of education and maintain this commitment for at least a decade.Such a scale up would include AI-related Level 7 apprenticeships, Masters programmes, Centres for Doctoral
The Council’s vision is for everyone to be able to live confidently with AI, and for those who go on to work with it and to build it to do so with the very best foundation.For the most technically talented individuals we need to guarantee a best- in-class postgraduate offering to access globally attractive pathways that will contribute to the country’s renowned research base.Success will depend on increasing the diversity of people working on and with AI until those AI communities reflect the society they inhabit. It’s important to focus on diversity; not as an afterthought, but because doing so will generate crucial research questions and lead to the widest and most innovative range of future technologies which will serve the needs of the people. There are wonderful examples of emergent leadership,
creativity, and energy in promoting diversity but it is not enough. We suggest benchmarking and forensically tracking levels of diversity and inclusion in AI as the NCSC17 has recently done for cyber security, to make data-led decisions about where to invest and ensure that underrepresented groups are included in funding programs. Government must do more to encourage the best of the existing initiatives where diversity is enabled, and to expand with their own schemes and campaigns, if the needle is to be sufficiently moved.What everyone needs to knowThe UK needs to set itself challenging but realistic goals to ensure that every child leaves school with a basic sense of how AI works. This is not just about understanding the basics of coding or quantitative reasoning, or to describe the mathematical concepts; nor is it simply
as being its own subject AI needs to be part of computer science, citizenship studies, and as part of new ways of doing other subjects such as geography or history. These changes may take a decade to complete but getting there is essential. For now, the government should focus energy on the most effective existing curriculum enrichment initiatives, not as alternatives to fundamental changes to the curriculum, but because they provide opportunities to accelerate change in the short term.Further, Higher and Graduate EducationSince the AI Review in 2017, the government has invested significantly in schemes to promote graduate-level learning through Apprenticeships, Masters courses and PhD training. This is a good start, but only that. Current numbers would suggest there is unmet
Training and novel forms of PhDs. It would extend the scope of the schemes to include AI-related courses in disciplines outside those traditionally associated with data sciences, with a review of digital apprenticeship standards to identify where additional AI knowledge and skills ought to be unlocked. It must also include the postgraduate AI and data science conversion course programme announced by the government last year, whose 2,500 places for people to develop new skills or re-train. Properly implemented, this commitment would help level up access to economic development across regions. We must also ensure that no graduate student leaves university without some grounding in AI and its applications.

Meanwhile the Turing AI Fellowships programme for established researchers, an international fellowship programme for AI in the UK in a partnership between UKRI, the Office for AI, and the Turing, has already seen a successful first wave,18 alongside the first batch of Turing AI Acceleration Fellowships.19 In line with the 2017 AI Review, this programme must continue to be developed and expanded so that momentum can be built to attract world-leading talent to the UK.These efforts, directed at the supply side, would allow graduates and apprentices to advance into emerging AI professions. They would need to be delivered across the country and to be available to young people of all backgrounds, ensuring that the UK’s future AI workforce reflects the diversity of background and thought needed to develop world leading AI capabilities that tackle the issues which matter most. Success will depend on collaboration between universities, colleges and businesses, not only in terms of how academia can help support continuous learning and upskilling within businesses, but also through business support such as mentoring, real life use cases and data to academia.Supporting every teacherThe key to progress in schools is to enable teachers to have confidence in the basics themselves, so they can make the best possible choices about how to engage their students. One way to make progress relatively fast would be to
extend the work of the NCCE, supporting it to provide comprehensive curriculum resources that cover AI at all Key Stages, and providing an incentive and opportunity for teachers to learn and develop their AI knowledge. A comprehensive programme aimed at all teachers and with a clear deadline for completion would enable every teacher confidently to get to grips with AI concepts in ways that are relevant to their own teaching.As in many other subjects, learning should combine access to knowledge about AI with exercises based on tackling real-world problems in ways that encourage the skills associated with problem-solving (including creativity and resilience) and team-working. Therefore new curriculum resources need to include curated data sets that will enable teachers to create the case studies and exercises that will in turn create the familiarity that leads all young people to increased confidence and data literacy.Lifelong learning and an online academy for AILooking across society, the scale of re- skilling and up-skilling that will be required is vast when you consider a population whose working lives may last more than half a century beyond the time they left school, college or university. The UK must contend with changing business models in goods and services, and the changing nature of professions and trades, and the priority of levelling up.
These challenges point to the need for significant change in the contract between the state, individual and employer and a step change in the scale of continuous professional development and the ability to move between types of work.While these socio-economic trends cut across sectors and subjects, they represent an even more urgent challenge in AI where the required skills have recently emerged and are still changing rapidly.20 The government should consider the two following major steps.The first is extending business tax relief from investment in research, development and innovation to investment in specified forms of retraining and upskilling, including AI.A second step would be to enable the creation of an Online Academy for AI. Such an Academy could provide a key part of the social infrastructure necessary to support systemic change. Properly designed, such an Academy would provide the opportunity efficiently and creatively to meet several overlapping needs which emerge from different parts of this Roadmap. It might start by providing entry-level material to support life-long learning. Ideally, this would be accredited in a recognisable and portable way. In doing this it could also provide an entry-point and repository for online learning aimed at teachers, complementing the work of bodies such as the NCCE, and it would encourage the
growing national community of product managers retooling for the future in AI. Either separately, or integrated into the Academy, a ‘data skills observatory’ to identify and address the on-going and evolving data skills deficit function that would otherwise hinder AI innovation would also be needed.While the Academy’s main objective would be to enable more people to live and work with AI, it would also be well placed to help connect and support local initiatives involving public engagement and public dialogue as part of responsible innovation in new AI deployments, including moonshots. This sustained and distributed resource, rather than, say, a single educational or promotional campaign, would be an integral part of negotiating the benefits and the risks of AI across different applications and publics and finding new forms of settlement and new narratives. It would help to ensure that trustworthy information, in relevant and accessible forms, informed public narratives on AI across sectors and applications. It would need to be able to reach into the forefront of research, development and innovation, such as through the Turing, and to connect people and information for discussions on opportunities, the distribution of benefits and of risks, shortcomings and uncertainties.This kind of resource would in turn underpin the regulatory infrastructure that is outlined in the next section, by ensuring that public debates were consistently well-informed.

3. Data,Infrastructure and Public Trust
deployment of suitable privacy enhancing technologies.22 This should be furthered by accelerating work on translating the intent of a data sharing agreement into an actionable legal framework, and establishing guidelines for legal frameworks around different data sharing structures such as trusts, cooperatives and contracts.It will be important to note that while some AI systems will continue to rely on access to the largest possible data sets, volume should not be the only priority for schemes to promote access: some of the next generation of AI technologies will be
licences where possible, working better with multi-modal data (big data, small data, noisy data, unstructured data) and enforcing an agreed supporting framework on what it means ethically and for society to share data for research purposes, and who owns it.Ultimately, developers of AI applications ought to consider the opening and sharing of research, analytics and data at the fundamental design stage. This should include encouraging digital research, development and innovation infrastructure, software and tools to be open and standardised; providing access
The UK should aspire to be the best place in the world to access and use safe, secure and good quality data in order to develop new applications and business models.The UK should also be the best place for the public to exercise scrutiny of, and input to, automated decision making, in order to ensure the public can trust AI. To do this, the infrastructure it will need is not only physical, such as broadband networks and high performance computing capacity, but also virtual and social, encompassing processes, people, standards, governance and practices. A systemic reimagining of data availability and governance will be required across disciplines to transform traditional practices and public acceptability.As for other infrastructure assets of national importance, the government has a key role in funding and providing data
infrastructure. An important component to this should be in creating a cross- sectoral Information Management Framework that is AI-friendly and designed for clean, codified, real-time data so that it forms the best possible basis for private and public sector innovation.Trustworthy and accessible dataAI thrives on data, and makes new demands on data collection, curation and use. The government should focus its plans to make more public sector data safely and securely available, being clear about which data will be increasingly available, under what conditions and on what timescale. In the private sector, while regulators have begun good work to audit AI for personal data protection compliance21, more work is needed to help businesses seeking to use data for AI by creating the conditions for the
designed to work with much smaller data sets. This illustrates a more general principle which is that the detailed infrastructure needed to make AI work in different markets is often very context- specific, and the UK will need a National AI Strategy that links general principles to industry-specific arrangements of governance to enable innovation and growth. One need shared by many markets, however, is in establishing data infrastructure to permit companies to safely share and access data to develop common AI-related products. The public sector should lead the way with examples of good data sharing practices.Good AI research, development and innovation relies on a bedrock of good data practices and there is much to do to improve the current position. This includes embedding data principles such as FAIR (Findable, Accessible Interoperable, Reusable), adopting open
to large-scale compute and data resources tuned to AI applications; and supporting the development and deployment of Trusted Research Environments, which enables collaboration and data access across several organisations.While previous work around best practices in data management and use has been helpful in setting the direction of travel, there remains a gap between the aspirations set out in these principles and their implementation, creating an additional barrier to the development of effective data access frameworks. Further work is needed to build a common language amongst data practitioners, building understanding of the nature of the datasets being used and how best to manage them. In many cases, data can outlive the systems that collected it, and conscious investment in trustworthy systems that can outlive the lifecycle of

our standard modes of data management will reap many benefits.The emergence of a small number of big players in several digital markets has sparked a timely debate on the proper role of government and regulators in preserving and enhancing competition across the digital economy. The role of data as a driver of concentration and potential barrier to entry for smaller firms has been a central theme of recent reviews.23 The government has also recognised the growing importance of data access and openness to promoting competition and innovation, having established a dedicated Digital Markets Unit to advise on the functions, processes and powers which may be needed to address the challenges posed by fast-moving digital markets.24Whatever the government’s final decision, clear and flexible regulation will be critical to supporting good data practices, and can help to level the playing field for new entrants into digital and data-driven markets. There remains much to be done in interpreting existing data rules to support research, development and innovation and well-resourced, independent regulators can assist in providing guidance.In addition to these systemic changes, the government might consider enhancing the nations’ approach to data governance: making sure data is collected, used and shared in responsible and trustworthy ways. Not appropriately
addressing data governance frameworks would maintain a fundamental barrier to the adoption and diffusion of AI technologies and inhibit the quality of wider sources of data. We recommend a coalition of institutions and experts work together to develop standard data sharing agreements compliant with data protection and intellectual property law but providing practical exemplars, especially for business-to-business data sharing that could be adapted and adopted across the economy. Without a strong system of data governance, existing tenuous public trust in data use and sharing will persist, impairing the UK’s long-term leadership ambitions.Public trust and good governanceThreaded throughout discussions about AI is the need for adaptive and informed regulation and standards as part of an enabling environment of good governance, which includes public engagement, transparency measures and responsible research and innovation on the part of businesses through the lifecycle of AI operations. Achieving such a robust system of good governance is crucial to building the public trust and confidence in AI that will be essential to its uptake and long-term public acceptability.Recent events have demonstrated that public and private sector AI and algorithmic applications continue to be plagued by public scepticism and lack
widespread legitimacy. Developing and deploying trustworthy AI will be dependent on the UK strengthening its governing environment in a manner that both provides guidance and confidence to businesses to innovate and adopt AI, and reassures the public that the use of AI is safe, secure, fair, ethical and duly overseen by independent entities. This is beginning to be addressed in the National Data Strategy,25 but further exploration and scrutiny of appropriate governance mechanisms, particularly concerning public sector adoption of AI, is overdue.We highlight one example in this section -a public interest data bill - that may serve as a method of increasing accountability through public engagement.It is clear that there remains a fundamental mismatch between the logic of the market and the logic of the law.Technology markets extract value from collective data while laws respond to individual opportunities and threats. This has a critical impact on the public acceptability of data as infrastructure - data supported by people, processes and technology - and will only worsen if it is not sufficiently addressed.One method that could begin to combine new forms of innovation and accountability is to involve the public in considering new ways to complement individual rights-based approaches such as consent. These would include new ways of ensuring public scrutiny of automated decision-making and the types of transparency that lead to
accountability: revealing the purposes and training data behind algorithms, as well as looking at their impacts. They would include public engagement, including in algorithmic impact assessments. And they would look to ensure that existing regulations and regulatory bodies had not only the capacity, but also the capability to fully consider the implications of AI in areas such as labour, environmental, and criminal law. These three tenets: (1) clear transparency about automated decision making, (2) the right to give meaningful public input and (3) the ability to enforce sanctions could be encapsulated in a Public Interest Data Bill.26Fundamental to the development of AI systems is access to data. The UK’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted gaps in the UK’s capabilities in this space, in particular around the governance of ‘happenstance’ data, generated by individuals in the course of their daily activities.27 Trustworthy access to such data can help generate insights for public policy and research, enabling the government to better understand the impact of its policy interventions in rapidly-evolving circumstances. Their expertise in the collection and management of data means the Office for National Statistics is well-placed to lead the development of governance frameworks for these new data sources.Government should enhance their role inthis respect through the National Data Strategy and associated policy frameworks.

Making the UK the best place in the world to research and use AI requires it to be world-leading in the provision of responsive regulation and governance. While fundamental principles of good governance may be fixed and apply across sectors, the details will not, and this means that the systems of governance themselves need to be ready to respond and adapt more frequently than has typically been true of systems of governance in the past. We therefore suggest commissioning an independent entity to provide recommendations on the next steps in the evolution of governance mechanisms, including impact and risk assessments, best practice principles, ethical processes and institutional mechanisms that will increase and sustain public trust.Public trust in the applications of AI and algorithms depends on the trustworthiness of these applications and those that develop and implement these. Good governance also needs to encourage good culture amongst the individuals and organisations that are responsible for the development and application of advanced information technology. At the same time, the UK needs to continue investing in data- specific regulatory capacity and algorithmic accountability, ensuring that institutions are well funded to cover the advisory, enforcement and regulatory landscapes as sector digitalisation continues at pace. UK governance should combine sector-specific expertise with cross-sector insights, bringing regulators
in different sectors together to connect with each other and begin to experiment with new ways of encouraging safe AI innovation across and within their remit.Digital Twins and Living LabsApplying AI systems responsibly inevitably requires a great deal of development before getting anywhere near the physical world. Digital twins (a realistic representation of assets, processes, systems or institutions in the built, societal or natural environments) are increasingly recognised as important in many fields as they can provide insight into how complex physical assets and citizens behave in real time and can help organisations improve decision-making and optimising processes. An expanded programme to advance digital twin capability, with interoperable data standards, could help developers explore the potential for applications in the physical world but cheaper, faster and with less risk, as well as a better understanding of the implications and impacts to society and the economy. AI thrives when stitching digital twins together, using machine learning algorithms to analyse complex patterns and make decisions between different processes and systems alongside generating new insights with newly hybridised datasets.The National Digital Twin Programme, currently being driven by the Centre for Digital Built Britain, aims to create an Information Management Framework to
enable the building of digital twins across the built environment. Building on this work, a more ambitious cross-sectoral UK Digital Twin programme, governed by the Gemini Principles28, would be a moonshot challenge and would encourage more widespread use of open synthetic data to develop AI applications in many specific potential applications where the risks to individuals or society might otherwise be large. AI could also use these digital twins to explore real world optimisations that are beyond human scale.In developing those AI applications and AI models and testing with synthetic data, there comes a point when you must begin to model and rehearse in the real world with messy, unpredictable and diverse environments. To achieve this in a safe way without causing inadvertent harm, the UK needs to create a nationwide network of living laboratories, physical environments that start as representations of the real world but more constrained.AI will provide the embedded intelligence within all manner of new smart machines, many with autonomous capabilities, that can work collaboratively with humans to transform their productivity, safety and quality of life. By enabling the fast and safe development, testing and demonstration of new AI-based goods and services, including distributed software systems and intelligence embodied in smart machines and products, businesses, researchers and
citizens can gather the data and experience necessary to inform future policy, regulation, products and services.A globally leading roleFinally, the UK should urgently and sustainably build upon its strong international position. It is one of the top three countries in terms of research publications in AI.29 This strength combined with the UK’s diplomatic weight can be a catalyst to shape international discussions, but our leading international position is not guaranteed. We should therefore strengthen existing partnerships with other like-minded countries, such as France and Canada as well as consider carefully how to increase bilateral cooperation with countries like the US and China, such as through the recent declaration signed with the US to increase collaboration on AI R&D,30 to enable effective strategic action to shape a global AI landscape. One immediate way forward is to leverage our founding membership in the Global Partnership for AI (GPAI), a scalable club of like-minded governments ready to be led by experts on tackling the most pressing priorities for collaboration, where the UK is already leading on data governance.31The UK has a pivotal opportunity to play an influential role in the coming year as it adopts the Presidency of the G7 and the 26th UN Climate Change conference.Over this period the UK should use this opportunity to leverage global collective

intelligence to advise on the biggest challenges AI presents and position the UK as a centre to operationalise recommendations, including those relating to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.Alongside global leadership on shared challenges, the UK ought to consider its own strategic advantage as we endeavour to become less dependent on critical technologies from non-allied sources of supply. Advancements in AI products and services underpin the capacity to compete economically but is also the domain of contests between overseas power bases and other nation states, which are sometimes not well aligned to the UK interest. One way to respond to this shift in geopolitical context is to invest strategically in research, development and innovation, choosing areas of national strengths such as AI and supporting them heavily with the aim of becoming globally competitive.If we align this strategic investment with the construction of broad coalitions of interest on the global stage, the UK can increase our sovereign capabilities and attract researchers and technologists with the skills to develop leading products in a number of competitive sectors. Government should also consider how to redefine procurement and intellectual property to encourage a creative technology ecosystem to achieve these aims.

4. National, Cross-sector Adoption
The largest companies that are able to realise the potential of AI through business transformation find themselves increasing productivity, reducing costs and innovating faster to remain competitive. By ensuring the enabling foundations described in the first 10 recommendations are in place, the UK can also be a fertile ground for its existing FTSE 100 and the future 100.Supporting high growth AI startupsAs these businesses initiatives stimulate demand for AI products, we need to
the funding gap that exists at series B+ means that AI companies struggle to stay under UK ownership. Government may consider supporting at this stage to ensure companies can take foreign investments in these rounds while also staying in the UK as they grow.The UK government needs to assist startups and scaleups to compete most effectively for the best talent. The Study Visa program may need to be extended now we have left the European Union. To this end, there is a prominent role for the government to position the UK as the go- to AI startup location in the region. It’s
The preceding sections outline the pillars that would provide the basis for sustained uptake of AI across the country and the economy as a whole.This section proposes transitional and other more specific measures to boost initial take up and to evolve existing markets in the crucial areas of business adoption, startup & scale-up support, public sector adoption, health and social care, climate change, and defence.Business as smart adoptersAcross society and the economy, and since the first weeks of 2020, the COVID- 19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital systems such as e- commerce platforms and marketplaces, and tools to enable remote working. The UK therefore has an opportunity to build on this momentum to showcase and reward the uptake of AI by encouraging
further investment and enabling business, especially SMEs, to be smart consumers for AI systems.Creating confidence so that business customers increasingly seek out AI solutions, knowing that they will be able to get sound advice and robust products, is crucial. There is further need to build on grants to access impartial advice on how to use digital and AI solutions to help the growth of SMEs that have been exacerbated by the COVID crisis.Scotland’s Data Lab is a good example of an initiative that fosters trusted collaboration between industry and AI expertise, having invested in 120 Collaborative Innovation Projects at approximately £12 million value over the last 5 years, and recently launched a Torch Business Advisory Service to support SMEs on their data journey.
ensure that the AI startup and scaleup vendor ecosystem thrives. Supporting AI- first businesses by providing the necessary physical infrastructure to offer services to the largest and smallest local and multinational companies would help these businesses scale, develop and become the next multi billion dollar companies.The government should encourage more initiatives like Tech Nation’s Applied AI Program32 to directly support smaller startups to grow across the UK. The community welcomed an additional £200 million from the British Business Bank which increased VC funding to high growth companies,33 and there is a compelling argument to increase this funding, or alternatively to consider public investment in promising companies that seek to advance government priorities in a similar style to the National Security Strategic Investment Fund. For scaleups,
important to spread the message that the UK has more capital and talent than anywhere else34 and a unique proximity of buyer to vendor as well as being far easier to incorporate and run a business here than in Europe.To increase the number of SMEs and build the right entrepreneurial infrastructure for AI-first companies, it is also worth exploring the possibility of building on Innovate UK’s Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), in which the government could introduce a series of AI-specific KTPs to stimulate market ready AI research in areas of direct relevance to businesses to commercialise research.The UK currently lacks a prominent cohort of professionals who understand the complex sales and leadership skills needed to build, articulate and sell AI tools and develop leaders of AI research labs, and there is concurrently a specific

demand to increase the number of skilled product managers in AI. We recommend a marketing campaign and programs to encourage international product managers to come to the UK, and for UK citizens to focus their education or re-skilling in this direction. This would help turbo charge the UK’s ability to effectively commercialise the world class research coming out of our universities.Enabling public sector adoptionThe UK public sector will be a priority area when it comes to AI innovation. Improving policy-making processes (for example, ensuring it is more resilient to shocks to the system), and the provision of more efficient and effective public services (for example, using data-driven ‘real-time’ economic forecasts), built on strong ethical foundations, will become essential to improve the security and well-being of citizens.There is an urgent need to have a digitally and data enabled local and national government. To leverage the opportunities of AI in the public sector, there will need to be new ways of ensuring that data can be accessed and evaluated across public sector organisations. The government should ensure there is a central place for civil servants to access information about all of the AI-based tools and projects being undertaken across departments. AI
absolutely appropriate, and departments should learn rapidly from each other about what works well and what needs to evolve. In time, the focus should be on linking public sector data with private sector data, rapidly enhancing the insights that can be gained through diverse datasets and a more sophisticated adoption of AI.35Government should fund interdisciplinary pathfinder projects – requiring collaboration between industries and across government departments, with different academic disciplines – as a means of demonstrating the potential of AI technologies to support pathfinder projects and building capability in the civil service to deliver such projects.Importantly, the application of AI in the public sector should not fall explicitly on one department to lead. It may be that a Chief Information Officer embedded in the heart of government would work well to provide the strategic direction and leadership required for such a multi- stakeholder task.The huge benefits of data sharing will be worth little unless government departments are enabled to intelligently procure products that suit different contexts and services. More work is needed to demystify algorithmic decision making in government, with training programs for officials so they can suitably assess AI systems for themselves and see how it would be deployed as part of an
data analysts across government trained in data science techniques this year,36 and to enable a more thorough upskilling of AI and machine learning analysis, work should intertwine with the Turing, the Royal Society, the Royal Statistical Society and others in determining how data science and AI practitioners may be professionally standardised.Public sector bodies wishing to adopt AI often face challenges in building procurement capability. Governments have tried to enable public procurement to better support innovative goods and services, while ensuring value for money and relatively low risk. This government should continue to build on initiatives that have worked, such as GovTech and the guidelines for AI procurement,37 to allow the public sector to effectively purchase emerging tech such as AI. Greater AI adoption in the public sector through public sector procurement creates markets for data science and AI technologies to be developed, tested and deployed by government departments, to enable a pull-through of innovation from research, often via SMEs.It is important to note that evidence shows the human rights of the poorest and most vulnerable are especially at risk when public services are automated.38 As such we suggest this work is done carefully and with independent ethics
committees tasked to consider ethics, including social and economic impacts.Health and social careThe demands on healthcare are changing rapidly as populations drift, age, and their needs evolve, and with a huge reduction in the cost of measurement. With this ubiquity of such data, informed and improved interventions through prioritisation and personalisation can maximise benefit.Given the social and economic importance of health and the UK’s potential to build on market opportunities created by the NHS, the sector has been, and should continue to be, at the forefront of AI adoption. The importance of the link between health, mental health and social care has been especially clear during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have also seen areas in which AI could have been better prepared to deal with that link if we had considered the promise of AI in this sector earlier. AI can help manage the complex information flow that is needed for the integration of these systems. NHSX, in delivering the Health Secretary’s Tech Vision39, is taking the lead in unblocking issues including (but not limited to) governance, data access and protection, and inclusion. The Council, who are supporting NHSX with their AI Lab40 and AI Awards,41 looks to NHSX to work with others across the research,

There is a fundamental need to consider transparency and data bias as public sector adoption increases, taking into account analysis and recommendations from, among others: Review on Artificial Intelligence and Public Standards, The Committee on Standards in Public Life (February 2020); CDEI review into bias in algorithmic decision-making, Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (November 2020)36 Looking to the future at the Data Science Campus, Office for National Statistics (March 2019)37 Guidelines for AI Procurement, UK Government ( June 2020).

development and innovation landscape to continue building towards these opportunities and developing best practice guidance for AI adoption in the healthcare sector.As the adoption of AI increases outside of the hospital setting, so too will the ‘datafication’ of networked digital technologies which create new health insights for individuals. This carries abundant opportunities for the preventative health of citizens, for example in stimulating new and more efficient ways to diagnose and prevent disease beyond clinical boundaries, but there are also significant concerns if not governed correctly. Individuals’ health quickly becomes legible to actors outside medical and clinical settings, for example inferred sensitive personal information held by online platforms, and appropriate oversight ought to be considered in how these technologies develop.We also encourage further development in areas with others in the sector where the UK can build a competitive advantage. Three particular areas stand out: the first is in creating a data strategy for health and care, which achieves clean, codified and real-time data with a strong sectoral data governance framework. The second is the opportunity to develop new models of partnership and incentives for partnerships between SMEs and the NHS that flourish and scale beyond ideation.
healthcare professionals living and working with AI technologies, building especially on the Topol review42 and NHS Digital Academy.Finally, building on the UK’s world-leading life sciences industry and increasingly digitally mature NHS, there is an opportunity to establish the UK as thego-to-place for biomedical research. With the appropriate governance in place, and through closer collaboration of the life sciences industry and the NHS, AI has the potential to empower large national trials more efficiently, including through the seamless adaptation of subjects to treatments.Climate changeAI technologies are an essential part of the toolbox for innovating to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and to reduce the environmental impacts of goods, services and human activities. We are already seeing AI contributing to a greater grasp of complex environmental and sustainability systems, from forecasting supply and demand at real- time43 to combating illegal deforestation44 and understanding Arctic sea ice loss.45 One way to accelerate the use of AI for these purposes would be to build it into relevant moonshots, such as that on new materials for energy storage and renewables and create incentives for AI companies to address these and other
The challenges to increased adoption of AI in related sectors, particularly in energy, has been explored elsewhere46 but echo similar constraints in other sectors, notably in the accessibility, interoperability and labelling of datasets that can contribute to cross-sector cooperation on energy and climate initiatives. The reality is also that the continued development of digital technologies, including AI and complementary technologies such as 5G and the Internet of Things, create an environmental impact that also needs to be monitored.As a part of the UK’s globally leading role in AI, there is an opportunity to carve out a leading path on the global stage where others see a similar need to increase the role of AI in energy and climate for public good. The UK should consider drawing up a plan that ensures responsible AI is suitable for the planet and helps build broader awareness, inform regulation, and incentivise researchers and developers to make more conscious and accountable decisions in these areas.Ahead of COP26, the UK should consider how to develop and showcase the UK’s ability in cleantech, which spans the entire country and represents a successful, innovative path to Net Zero,47 and use its spotlight to encourage an open, international digital ecosystem of data, algorithms and insights that can generate
reliable information in real-time about the state of the environment and interactions between the economy, society and the environment.Defence and securityAI is central to a broad range of defence and security applications, which are becoming increasingly data rich and networked. They require multiple sources of information to be brought together to understand a rapidly evolving situation, to determine a timely course of action and to oversee the enactment of the response. The information involved is often multi-modal (text, audio and video) and is invariably uncertain, incomplete and contradictory. Sometimes it is also intentionally misleading. AI methods are necessary to make sense of this volume, variety and velocity of information.However, further developments arerequired to scale the underpinning fusion techniques, to have them work in closer partnership with the humans involved, and to ensure the ensuing decisions and plans can be understood and justified.The increased connectivity of all aspects of our society means that digital assets are increasingly common, and valuable and physical assets are increasingly accessible remotely. These bring tremendous benefits, but also open up
The third opportunity would be to create a better understanding of the skills and knowledge required for citizens and
Net Zero challenges.42

opportunities for interference and disruption, leading to a requirement for a secure, connected intelligence. AI techniques are necessary to monitor the complexity of these networked systems and to determine when they are operating normally and when they are not. As cyber-attacks become increasingly sophisticated, AI is needed to detect and respond to them.We welcome the commitment to create a new MOD agency for AI, and look forward to further detail in the Integrated Review in 2021.We are now living in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment in which global tech companies hold sway over national strategic advantages. By strengthening our ties with like- minded nations, the UK can increase our capabilities in co-creating technological developments, drawing innovations from oblique application areas and developing leading products which are then adopted by our allies. The broader AI community will be required to engage in this space as the security sector becomes more pervasive, and the government will need to find ways of working across demanding security frameworks to enable wider collaboration.Part of opening up wider collaboration on this front will require new levels of internationally competitive investment in advanced hardware technologies that serve the UK ecosystem, as the driving force behind fast and secure innovation.
Co-creation – at scale – of technological developments in an application agnostic environment (benefiting from innovations from other application areas) could be a potential model. This would also provide additional benefits to improved technological export capabilities for Britain, and further benefits to attracting world-class technologists and innovators in this space, not seen in Britain since the 1980s.

Executive summary
As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in people’s lives, the UK finds itself at a pivotal moment.Estimates show that AI could deliver a 10% increase in UK GDP in 2030.1 If approached correctly, this would offer huge benefits to the economy, to recovery and resilience, the environment and for people from all walks of life across all parts of the UK. This summary report by the AI Council sets out long- term ambitions and suggests near-term directions for all government departments, with the aim of cementing the UK as one of the very best places in the world to live with, work with and develop AI.The UK starts from a place of strength in research, enterprise and regulation, and with its history of recent support for AI it stands among the best in the world. The UK government’s ambition should push
for scale and reliability in areas of unique advantage. To be influential in attracting talent, shaping global markets and global governance we call on the government to build a UK National AI strategy that scales up its investment for a decade and beyond.This report has two underlying messages. The first is that we need to “double down” on recent investment the UK has made in AI. The second message is that we must look to the horizon and be adaptable to disruption. Support for AI needs to reflect the rapid pace and evolution of the science & technology and its applications. This means staying at the forefront of the development of AI and integrating approaches to ethics, security and social impacts and planning for the next 10-50 years. The UK will only feel the full benefits of AI if all parts of society have full confidence in the science and the technologies, and in the governance and

regulation that enable them. That confidence will depend on the existence of systems that ensure full accountability, clear ethics and transparency. Developing the best science and the most robust applications requires commitment to an ambitious programme of investment in talent; one that promotes cutting edge skills and does so in ways that makes AI accessible in ways that are more diverse and inclusive.Given the breadth and significance of potential AI applications, this Roadmap is concerned with overcoming the challenges of enabling change. It sets out suggested directions across four pillars: Research, Development & Innovation; Skills and Diversity, and Data, Infrastructure and Public Trust - and then, in the final section, addresses some specific measures to support adoption and the key areas of health, climate and defence.
This Roadmap and its recommendations reflects the views of the Council as well as 100+ additional experts. We recognise it will not be possible to achieve all at once, and this is why a National AI Strategy is needed to prioritise and set a time frame that will position the UK for success. In order to support the government, we are ready to convene workshops with the wider ecosystem in order to capture more detail and work together to ensure that a future National AI Strategy enables the whole of the UK to flourish.
1 The economic impact of artificial intelligence on the UK economy, PwC ( June 2017)1 
16 recommendations to help thegovernment develop a UK National AI Strategy
Research, Development and Innovation1. Scale up and make sustainable public sector investment in AI; ensure consistent access to top talent from around the world; and find new ways to bring researchers, disciplines and sectors together. Build on the commitments in the government’s R&D Roadmap2 and suggestions in the soon to be published UKRI AI review3.2. Cement The Alan Turing Institute as a truly national institute, with a set of regional investments that draw on strengths from across the UK.Provide assured long term public sector funding that will give the Turing and others the confidence to plan and invest in strategic leadership for the UK in AI research, development and innovation.3. Ensure moonshots, as described in the R&D Roadmap as challenge-led, high-risk, scalable programmes, are both advancing and leveraging AI. These could tackle fundamental challenges such as creating “explainable AI”, or important goals in any area where AI can contribute strongly, such as the UK Digital Twin program or developing smart materials for energy storage in the move towards Net Zero carbon emissions.
Skills and Diversity4. Scale up and commit to an ongoing 10 year programme of high level AI skill- building. This would include research fellowships, AI-relevant PhDs across disciplines, industry-led Masters and level 7 apprenticeships.5. Make diversity and inclusion a priority. We suggest benchmarking and forensically tracking levels of diversity to make data-led decisions about where to invest and ensure that underrepresented groups are given equal opportunity and included in all programs.6. Commit to achieving AI and data literacy for everyone. The public needs to understand the risks and rewards of AI so they can be confident and informed users. An online academy for understanding AI, with trusted materials and initiatives would support teachers, school students and lifelong learning.1. 
AI ROADMAP	5
Data, Infrastructure and Public Trust7. Consolidate and accelerate the infrastructure needed to increase access to data for AI. Invest in the relevant organisations, link general principles to specific applications, and pursue initiatives for pump priming innovation and enabling safe data sharing for valuable uses.8. Lead the development of data governance options and its uses. The UK should lead in developing appropriate standards to frame the future governance of data.9. Ensure public trust through public scrutiny. The UK must lead in finding ways to enable public scrutiny of, and input to, automated decision-making and help ensure that the public can trust AI.10. Thoughtfully position the UK with respect to other major AI nations. Building on its strengths, the UK has a crucial opportunity to become a global lead in good governance, standards and frameworks for AI and enhance bilateral cooperation with key actors.

2 UK Research and Development Roadmap, UK Government ( July 2020)3 [To be published early 2021]1 
Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is breaking into the mainstream of societies and the global economy.The history of AI is characterised by cycles of boom and bust, with waves of excessive hype followed by “AI winters”. This time things are different: advances in machine learning and neural networks have led to great advances in fields such as computer vision and speech recognition, and natural language processing, with numerous applications used by hundreds of millions of people on a daily basis. Safely harnessed AI is revolutionising certain types of tasks, disrupting business models, and complementing and enhancing human capabilities in wholly new ways. These tremendous advances have come from increasing the sizes of training data sets, and the associated networks and compute power, by factors of a million or more, along with modifications to the
underlying algorithms, many of which have been with us in some form for a long time. This accounts for tens of billions of dollars in global annual value creation, and looks set to increase markedly over the coming decade.4The UK has fundamental strengths in AI which reach back to the intellectual origins of the science, with figures like Alan Turing, Joan Clarke, Donald Michie and many others, to its ability to debate and enact sound governance of new technologies. Successive governments, businesses and civil groups have worked hard to make increasing amounts of data and information more available in ways that combine safety and usefulness.In recent years, the UK has been the site of an array of initiatives aimed at developing and deploying AI across the economy for society. Building on these with focus and structure will ensure AI is

an essential part of tackling the major challenges of economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, of levelling up the UK economy through the creation of jobs and prosperity beyond London and the South East, of ensuring new forms of health and social care, of reaching net zero carbon emissions, and of ensuring resilience to future economic, health, or environmental shocks. It will also create entirely new opportunities for human flourishing.These fundamental strengths and recent initiatives have helped the UK to be amongst the global leaders in many areas of AI, from accelerating drug discovery5 to helping businesses make decisions that accurately factor in climate volatility.6However, the next few months and years will be crucial in determining where the UK places its desired level of ambition in AI, as massive investments by governments and businesses around the world are already priming themselves to influence the global conversation. The scale of effort elsewhere must not be underestimated: Germany has committed €3.1 billion towards a national AI strategy up to 20257, and France has pledged €1.5 billion up to 2022, with almost half earmarked for research.8 While the UK has played a leading role in the development of AI, the US has recently announced $1 billion over the
coming five years to open 12 new institutes that will keep the country at the forefront of research in AI and quantum computing9, and like-minded countries such as Canada and Germany are leading on commercialisation as measured by patents.10The Council calls for a UK National AI Strategy that creates an even stronger general base of support for AI. Scotland has already embarked on an AI Strategy and the UK strategy should be created in consultation with the devolved administrations and the wider ecosystem.The UK cannot, and need not try to, compete equally in all economic sectors so it must shape its strategy carefully to ensure it prioritises and is able to act selectively to lead and to capture markets around the world. In doing this it will need to consider its options for collaboration and competition within the international scientific and economic landscapes.
4 Some estimates show that leading nations could gain an extra 20-25% in economic growth and productivity gains through AI over the next decade.

The Council has considered how to diffuse the development of AI across sections of society that would help to both improve the lives of its citizens and bring economic benefits in the form of recovery and resilience. This has resulted in four pillars:ï support for research, development and innovation;ï literacy in AI across the population with enhanced AI-related skills at all levels of educational and lifelong attainment;ï sound physical, digital and virtual infrastructure, including robust and flexible regulation as a form of social infrastructure, resulting in good governance that boosts public trust;ï and pragmatic approaches to national, cross-sector adoption that meaningfully advances public and private sector applications.This Roadmap sets out the requirements in each of these areas in more detail and builds on the 2017 Hall-Pesenti AI Review. Its premise is that, in most areas, what the UK needs to do is to “double down” on the best of the investments it has already made, and to accelerate what’s proved to be ‘working building’ capability across organisations and sectors. Doing this is not easy, and least of all in the face of jobs at risk that could be made more vulnerable by the twin pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic and automation.12
Fundamentally, it requires commitments of a size, and for sustained timescales, that are often only possible at times of disruption such as the one the world is going through now with its response and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It therefore requires a degree of collective vision and of boldness, combining this leadership with the confidence to create spaces for entrepreneurism in all parts of society and the economy in order to find new ways to use AI to benefit everyone.In a small number of important areas this Roadmap points in new directions. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, developing trustworthy technology is vital and businesses will require a novel approach to good governance and consideration of the ethical and societal implications of AI as part of the design process, with greater multi-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary approaches throughout. The UK needs to develop a world-class enabling environment with strong but flexible legislation and well- resourced, capable regulators able to provide responsive guidance and timely oversight.This Roadmap is not a draft strategy, and nor is it an instruction manual. This is a set of recommendations and we recognise it will not be possible to achieve all at once. This is why a National AI Strategy is needed to prioritise and set a time frame. We are ready to convene workshops across all of the areas laid out in this Roadmap, and more, to capture the full spectrum of thought across the
12 Who is at risk?, The Royal Society for Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (October 2020) finds that, broadly speaking, industries with the highest level of furlough take-up are more likely to be at risk of automation.
UK in a way that would lend itself to the development of a UK National AI Strategy. We have set out a clear direction that we believe will accelerate the UK to a positive technological future and start the necessary conversations needed to create a strategy that will enable the whole of the UK to flourish.
1. Research, Development and Innovation
AI’s full potential will only be realised in the UK if the government continues to create the conditions for leading edge research, development and innovation in AI for the public and private sectors, and if it creates the conditions for AI to work in and with multiple disciplines and areas of society and the economy.In common with some other parts of this Roadmap, what can seem like a restatement of general principles that could be taken for granted is, in fact, a challenging requirement for sustained systemic change.The government’s R&D Roadmap13 makes an excellent start in outlining some of the areas of systemic change that will particularly benefit AI. One of the most important commitments is to make the UK a place that is open and inviting to top talent. Demand for AI talent is at an
all-time high, and there is more to do to attract and retain the very best to the UK’s shores. Skills training, both at a research and workforce level, is vital to translate research, development and innovation, and suggestions are detailed in the forthcoming section.The government R&D Roadmap includes valuable commitments to strengthening the interactions between discovery and applied research, innovation, commercialisation and deployment. This is vital: funding either excellent basic or applied research in isolation risks the outputs and the people being easily transferred to other countries, so any competitive advantage can be easily and quickly lost, especially to other countries that have more resources than the UK. The R&D Roadmap also signifies support for entrepreneurs; creating a more place- based approach to research, development and innovation; and the

aspiration to be more imaginative in ways of ensuring that research and innovation is directly responsive to the needs and aspirations of society. This last point echoes strongly the views of the AI Council’s ecosystem.In addition to building on these broad directions, there are three areas which are more specific to AI and on which the government needs to take significant action.The Alan Turing Institute: local presences and global reachThe first is to build on the existing success of The Alan Turing Institute as a national champion for AI research, development and innovation in the UK. In a relatively short period of time the Turing has developed to play a pivotal role in promoting AI research across sectors and in attracting talent by leveraging its growing network. Over the past year, the Turing has attracted 77 new Turing Fellows, bringing the total to 369, and 21 new research associates alongside 116 events across their research portfolio, and a student enrichment scheme intake representing 36% female and 32% from BAME backgrounds.14 It has also reached out to crowdsource best practice for data science and AI research, was pivotal in creating a new discipline in data-centric engineering, and has worked across government to provide policy advice and operational support.
Concentrating on these beginnings, an enhanced and reshaped Turing will be a crucial part of the necessary research, development and innovation infrastructure but, to play that role fully, some changes are needed. The UK’s research system as a whole cannot reach its full potential while the original membership model has the effect of inadvertently excluding excellent research teams across the four nations. The UK needs the Turing to have a full national reach so that it can play its part in levelling up and in supporting talent and great ideas wherever they start. To do this, it will need to be able to bring together researchers, businesses, civil groups and the public sector to make great ideas work at all geographic levels and at a sector-wide scale.A new Turing model might, for example, extend both its virtual and physical presences to energise more regional and local activity. There are several ways to achieve such aims, building on the Turing’s convening role in the UK landscape to join up and build on existing teams and infrastructure. This could be delivered through Turing acting as a headquarters and convenor of a nationally network of centres-of- excellence or hubs, which may be physical or virtual, which would not only advance AI research but also development, innovation and deployment into the regions. Across these centres, skills training will be at both the research level and, most importantly, in apprenticeships, upskilling and reskilling regional

workforces to exploit the opportunities of AI across sectors of the UK economy.Models for such centres might be based on, for example, UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, or focus on regions to support AI research, development and innovation capability to support the local economy.Well-funded institutes are becoming highly valued components of national AI strategies, and as a national institute of global standing, the Turing also needs the assured long term public sector funding that will give it and others the confidence to plan and invest for the medium term and strategic leadership for the UK, with the needs of academia, businesses, civil groups and the public sector reflected in its strategic direction. A well-funded UK institute would not only signal the UK’s commitment to remaining a globally leading player over the coming decades, it could also promote the UK’s interests through collaborations with international partners and enable it to play a significant role in building the international infrastructure discussed as part of the third pillar in this Roadmap.Sustainable funding would enable the Turing to provide visible national leadership on matters of AI security and ethics, and use this leadership role and connectivity across the landscape to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of next-generation AI developments, such as those involving machine learning from small data sets, and machine learning as part of wholly new types of neural
interface technologies.15 This added focus on how to leap-frog current machine learning-based AI technologies would enable the UK, through the Turing and its network-trusted and neutral status, to also become the place for Explainable AI, bringing us closer to safe, responsible and trustworthy AI.Challenge-led innovationThe significant promise of AI and its high risk, high reward, aspirational nature lends itself to goal-directed “moonshot” programmes in the style often associated with ARPA-esque models.16a Properly designed and delivered moonshot programmes play to AI’s strengths by requiring people to work across boundaries and existing organisational structures, and to build new relationships, networks and common languages in order to develop entirely new solutions to big challenges. In addition to this, there is a need for the UK to consider further the question of how AI interacts with people, and what it means to create effective human-AI partnerships.One such moonshot, directly relevant to AI, might involve a major challenge aimed at developing and establishing appropriate methods for safe, ethical, explainable and reproducible AI which will accelerate its use across many sectors. Another would be the development of an innovation ecosystem enabled by the UK Digital Twin programme, as discussed later in this
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION	13
Roadmap, within which AI would use these virtual worlds to explore real world optimisations that are beyond human scale.AI should also be built into moonshots in other sectors where it could play a major part, for example to radically accelerate materials science to develop new materials that can better store energy from renewable sources, or in solving for real-time control of the increasingly complex electricity distribution network as the country moves towards net zero emissions.Across all the potential types of challenge- based funding, programmes need to be selected and designed to draw in and accelerate AI’s integration across disciplines and sectors. One suggestion would be to select broad sectors that are more mature, and thus ripe for AI adoption than others, and use the mission-based approach to focus minds. This would bring together basic and applied research and multiple disciplines across research horizons and opportunities for systems development, helping to mature AI as a discipline.The specific vehicle for delivering moonshots is a ripe topic for discussion, but a forward-looking framework for research, development and innovation consisting of a series of labs, which conceive of and build fully engineered prototypes and platforms, could offer a flexible model of experimentation. These labs could generate vision-based
sequences of projects around moonshot challenges and could serve those with an interest in working between industry, academia and the public sector.By providing significant signals about potential future developments, moonshots create space for informed public and business engagement with the emerging science and applications. Under these circumstances the science and technology is not simply communicated to; it is inspired by, and carried out with, individuals, communities and businesses. Such space enables all those involved to explore how AI interacts with people and what it means to create human-AI partnerships. In turn, the projects will help define responsible and ethical practices to meet society’s needs and aspirations for a technology that behaves as people and businesses hope and expect: safely, securely and reliably.
15 iHuman perspective: Neural interfaces, The Royal Society (September 2019)16a The US’ Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) is a model designed to concentrate funding around pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies, often for national security purposes. DARPA (for Defense) is the most well-known ARPA agency in the US and is credited with developing a number of disruptive technologies such as stealth technology, the foundations of the Internet, and miniature GPS receivers.

AI to transform research, development and innovationCapitalising on the promise of AI will continue to require investment in basic research into the fundamentals of AI itself. Researchers, increasingly working across disciplines, will need to address some of the fundamental challenges that remain, such as establishing a common language through which to develop data science projects or interoperability between datasets, which can drive smart collaboration. AI systems often rely on a narrow disciplinary base, and this needs to be broadened to cover an array of domains in an intelligent way. AI technologies need to get better at extending into areas where they do not have structured data, and to navigate effectively through that.At the same time AI is transforming the nature of research itself, with examples in particle physics and bioinformatics.16b For the UK to retain its status as a global leader in research, it needs to stay well abreast of the potentially disruptive effects of AI and other forms of data science which are beginning to be incorporated into all forms of knowledge creation, including the social sciences and the humanities. Given the availability of massive data sets and computer power, such disruptions could range from game-changing increases in efficiency in routine tasks such as searching texts or large observational data sets, to entirely new forms of enquiry brought about by AI’s ability to
spot new patterns and prompt new questions and insights, often across existing disciplinary boundaries.

2. Skills and Diversity
The Council’s vision is for everyone to be able to live confidently with AI, and for those who go on to work with it and to build it to do so with the very best foundation.For the most technically talented individuals we need to guarantee a best- in-class postgraduate offering to access globally attractive pathways that will contribute to the country’s renowned research base.Success will depend on increasing the diversity of people working on and with AI until those AI communities reflect the society they inhabit. It’s important to focus on diversity; not as an afterthought, but because doing so will generate crucial research questions and lead to the widest and most innovative range of future technologies which will serve the needs of the people. There are wonderful examples of emergent leadership,
creativity, and energy in promoting diversity but it is not enough. We suggest benchmarking and forensically tracking levels of diversity and inclusion in AI as the NCSC17 has recently done for cyber security, to make data-led decisions about where to invest and ensure that underrepresented groups are included in funding programs. Government must do more to encourage the best of the existing initiatives where diversity is enabled, and to expand with their own schemes and campaigns, if the needle is to be sufficiently moved.What everyone needs to knowThe UK needs to set itself challenging but realistic goals to ensure that every child leaves school with a basic sense of how AI works. This is not just about understanding the basics of coding or quantitative reasoning, or to describe the mathematical concepts; nor is it simply
17
about ethics. It is about knowing enough to be a conscious and confident user of AI-related products; to know what questions to ask, what risks to look out for, what ethical and societal implications might arise, and what kinds of opportunities AI might provide. Without a basic literacy in AI specifically, the UK will miss out on opportunities created by AI applications, and will be vulnerable to poor consumer and public decision- making, and the dangers of over- persuasive hype or misplaced fear.Over time, AI needs to be built into the curriculum as a specialist subject. As well as being its own subject AI needs to be part of computer science, citizenship studies, and as part of new ways of doing other subjects such as geography or history. These changes may take a decade to complete but getting there is essential. For now, the government should focus energy on the most effective existing curriculum enrichment initiatives, not as alternatives to fundamental changes to the curriculum, but because they provide opportunities to accelerate change in the short term.Further, Higher and Graduate EducationSince the AI Review in 2017, the government has invested significantly in schemes to promote graduate-level learning through Apprenticeships, Masters courses and PhD training. This is a good start, but only that. Current numbers would suggest there is unmet
demand to justify a five to tenfold increase in places compared to the numbers in the AI Review.To ensure a steady supply of skilled entrants to the workforce, and to send the right signals to young people making further academic choices, the UK should commit to scaling up its programmes significantly at all levels of education and maintain this commitment for at least a decade.Such a scale up would include AI-related Level 7 apprenticeships, Masters programmes, Centres for Doctoral Training and novel forms of PhDs. It would extend the scope of the schemes to include AI-related courses in disciplines outside those traditionally associated with data sciences, with a review of digital apprenticeship standards to identify where additional AI knowledge and skills ought to be unlocked. It must also include the postgraduate AI and data science conversion course programme announced by the government last year, whose 2,500 places for people to develop new skills or re-train. Properly implemented, this commitment would help level up access to economic development across regions. We must also ensure that no graduate student leaves university without some grounding in AI and its applications.
17 Decrypting diversity: Diversity and inclusion in cyber security, NCSC ( July 2020)17 

Meanwhile the Turing AI Fellowships programme for established researchers, an international fellowship programme for AI in the UK in a partnership between UKRI, the Office for AI, and the Turing, has already seen a successful first wave,18 alongside the first batch of Turing AI Acceleration Fellowships.19 In line with the 2017 AI Review, this programme must continue to be developed and expanded so that momentum can be built to attract world-leading talent to the UK.These efforts, directed at the supply side, would allow graduates and apprentices to advance into emerging AI professions. They would need to be delivered across the country and to be available to young people of all backgrounds, ensuring that the UK’s future AI workforce reflects the diversity of background and thought needed to develop world leading AI capabilities that tackle the issues which matter most. Success will depend on collaboration between universities, colleges and businesses, not only in terms of how academia can help support continuous learning and upskilling within businesses, but also through business support such as mentoring, real life use cases and data to academia.Supporting every teacherThe key to progress in schools is to enable teachers to have confidence in the basics themselves, so they can make the best possible choices about how to engage their students. One way to make progress relatively fast would be to
extend the work of the NCCE, supporting it to provide comprehensive curriculum resources that cover AI at all Key Stages, and providing an incentive and opportunity for teachers to learn and develop their AI knowledge. A comprehensive programme aimed at all teachers and with a clear deadline for completion would enable every teacher confidently to get to grips with AI concepts in ways that are relevant to their own teaching.As in many other subjects, learning should combine access to knowledge about AI with exercises based on tackling real-world problems in ways that encourage the skills associated with problem-solving (including creativity and resilience) and team-working. Therefore new curriculum resources need to include curated data sets that will enable teachers to create the case studies and exercises that will in turn create the familiarity that leads all young people to increased confidence and data literacy.Lifelong learning and an online academy for AILooking across society, the scale of re- skilling and up-skilling that will be required is vast when you consider a population whose working lives may last more than half a century beyond the time they left school, college or university. The UK must contend with changing business models in goods and services, and the changing nature of professions and trades, and the priority of levelling up.
SKILLS AND DIVERSITY	19
These challenges point to the need for significant change in the contract between the state, individual and employer and a step change in the scale of continuous professional development and the ability to move between types of work.While these socio-economic trends cut across sectors and subjects, they represent an even more urgent challenge in AI where the required skills have recently emerged and are still changing rapidly.20 The government should consider the two following major steps.The first is extending business tax relief from investment in research, development and innovation to investment in specified forms of retraining and upskilling, including AI.A second step would be to enable the creation of an Online Academy for AI. Such an Academy could provide a key part of the social infrastructure necessary to support systemic change. Properly designed, such an Academy would provide the opportunity efficiently and creatively to meet several overlapping needs which emerge from different parts of this Roadmap. It might start by providing entry-level material to support life-long learning. Ideally, this would be accredited in a recognisable and portable way. In doing this it could also provide an entry-point and repository for online learning aimed at teachers, complementing the work of bodies such as the NCCE, and it would encourage the
growing national community of product managers retooling for the future in AI. Either separately, or integrated into the Academy, a ‘data skills observatory’ to identify and address the on-going and evolving data skills deficit function that would otherwise hinder AI innovation would also be needed.While the Academy’s main objective would be to enable more people to live and work with AI, it would also be well placed to help connect and support local initiatives involving public engagement and public dialogue as part of responsible innovation in new AI deployments, including moonshots. This sustained and distributed resource, rather than, say, a single educational or promotional campaign, would be an integral part of negotiating the benefits and the risks of AI across different applications and publics and finding new forms of settlement and new narratives. It would help to ensure that trustworthy information, in relevant and accessible forms, informed public narratives on AI across sectors and applications. It would need to be able to reach into the forefront of research, development and innovation, such as through the Turing, and to connect people and information for discussions on opportunities, the distribution of benefits and of risks, shortcomings and uncertainties.This kind of resource would in turn underpin the regulatory infrastructure that is outlined in the next section, by ensuring that public debates were consistently well-informed.

3. Data,Infrastructure and Public Trust
The UK should aspire to be the best place in the world to access and use safe, secure and good quality data in order to develop new applications and business models.The UK should also be the best place for the public to exercise scrutiny of, and input to, automated decision making, in order to ensure the public can trust AI. To do this, the infrastructure it will need is not only physical, such as broadband networks and high performance computing capacity, but also virtual and social, encompassing processes, people, standards, governance and practices. A systemic reimagining of data availability and governance will be required across disciplines to transform traditional practices and public acceptability.As for other infrastructure assets of national importance, the government has a key role in funding and providing data
infrastructure. An important component to this should be in creating a cross- sectoral Information Management Framework that is AI-friendly and designed for clean, codified, real-time data so that it forms the best possible basis for private and public sector innovation.Trustworthy and accessible dataAI thrives on data, and makes new demands on data collection, curation and use. The government should focus its plans to make more public sector data safely and securely available, being clear about which data will be increasingly available, under what conditions and on what timescale. In the private sector, while regulators have begun good work to audit AI for personal data protection compliance21, more work is needed to help businesses seeking to use data for AI by creating the conditions for the
21
deployment of suitable privacy enhancing technologies.22 This should be furthered by accelerating work on translating the intent of a data sharing agreement into an actionable legal framework, and establishing guidelines for legal frameworks around different data sharing structures such as trusts, cooperatives and contracts.It will be important to note that while some AI systems will continue to rely on access to the largest possible data sets, volume should not be the only priority for schemes to promote access: some of the next generation of AI technologies will be designed to work with much smaller data sets. This illustrates a more general principle which is that the detailed infrastructure needed to make AI work in different markets is often very context- specific, and the UK will need a National AI Strategy that links general principles to industry-specific arrangements of governance to enable innovation and growth. One need shared by many markets, however, is in establishing data infrastructure to permit companies to safely share and access data to develop common AI-related products. The public sector should lead the way with examples of good data sharing practices.Good AI research, development and innovation relies on a bedrock of good data practices and there is much to do to improve the current position. This includes embedding data principles such as FAIR (Findable, Accessible Interoperable, Reusable), adopting open
licences where possible, working better with multi-modal data (big data, small data, noisy data, unstructured data) and enforcing an agreed supporting framework on what it means ethically and for society to share data for research purposes, and who owns it.Ultimately, developers of AI applications ought to consider the opening and sharing of research, analytics and data at the fundamental design stage. This should include encouraging digital research, development and innovation infrastructure, software and tools to be open and standardised; providing access to large-scale compute and data resources tuned to AI applications; and supporting the development and deployment of Trusted Research Environments, which enables collaboration and data access across several organisations.While previous work around best practices in data management and use has been helpful in setting the direction of travel, there remains a gap between the aspirations set out in these principles and their implementation, creating an additional barrier to the development of effective data access frameworks. Further work is needed to build a common language amongst data practitioners, building understanding of the nature of the datasets being used and how best to manage them. In many cases, data can outlive the systems that collected it, and conscious investment in trustworthy systems that can outlive the lifecycle of
21 Guidance on AI and Data Protection, ICO (2020)22 Privacy Enhancing Technologies, The Royal Society (March 2019)17 

our standard modes of data management will reap many benefits.The emergence of a small number of big players in several digital markets has sparked a timely debate on the proper role of government and regulators in preserving and enhancing competition across the digital economy. The role of data as a driver of concentration and potential barrier to entry for smaller firms has been a central theme of recent reviews.23 The government has also recognised the growing importance of data access and openness to promoting competition and innovation, having established a dedicated Digital Markets Unit to advise on the functions, processes and powers which may be needed to address the challenges posed by fast-moving digital markets.24Whatever the government’s final decision, clear and flexible regulation will be critical to supporting good data practices, and can help to level the playing field for new entrants into digital and data-driven markets. There remains much to be done in interpreting existing data rules to support research, development and innovation and well-resourced, independent regulators can assist in providing guidance.In addition to these systemic changes, the government might consider enhancing the nations’ approach to data governance: making sure data is collected, used and shared in responsible and trustworthy ways. Not appropriately
addressing data governance frameworks would maintain a fundamental barrier to the adoption and diffusion of AI technologies and inhibit the quality of wider sources of data. We recommend a coalition of institutions and experts work together to develop standard data sharing agreements compliant with data protection and intellectual property law but providing practical exemplars, especially for business-to-business data sharing that could be adapted and adopted across the economy. Without a strong system of data governance, existing tenuous public trust in data use and sharing will persist, impairing the UK’s long-term leadership ambitions.Public trust and good governanceThreaded throughout discussions about AI is the need for adaptive and informed regulation and standards as part of an enabling environment of good governance, which includes public engagement, transparency measures and responsible research and innovation on the part of businesses through the lifecycle of AI operations. Achieving such a robust system of good governance is crucial to building the public trust and confidence in AI that will be essential to its uptake and long-term public acceptability.Recent events have demonstrated that public and private sector AI and algorithmic applications continue to be plagued by public scepticism and lack

widespread legitimacy. Developing and deploying trustworthy AI will be dependent on the UK strengthening its governing environment in a manner that both provides guidance and confidence to businesses to innovate and adopt AI, and reassures the public that the use of AI is safe, secure, fair, ethical and duly overseen by independent entities. This is beginning to be addressed in the National Data Strategy,25 but further exploration and scrutiny of appropriate governance mechanisms, particularly concerning public sector adoption of AI, is overdue.We highlight one example in this section -a public interest data bill - that may serve as a method of increasing accountability through public engagement.It is clear that there remains a fundamental mismatch between the logic of the market and the logic of the law.Technology markets extract value from collective data while laws respond to individual opportunities and threats. This has a critical impact on the public acceptability of data as infrastructure - data supported by people, processes and technology - and will only worsen if it is not sufficiently addressed.One method that could begin to combine new forms of innovation and accountability is to involve the public in considering new ways to complement individual rights-based approaches such as consent. These would include new ways of ensuring public scrutiny of automated decision-making and the types of transparency that lead to
accountability: revealing the purposes and training data behind algorithms, as well as looking at their impacts. They would include public engagement, including in algorithmic impact assessments. And they would look to ensure that existing regulations and regulatory bodies had not only the capacity, but also the capability to fully consider the implications of AI in areas such as labour, environmental, and criminal law. These three tenets: (1) clear transparency about automated decision making, (2) the right to give meaningful public input and (3) the ability to enforce sanctions could be encapsulated in a Public Interest Data Bill.26Fundamental to the development of AI systems is access to data. The UK’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted gaps in the UK’s capabilities in this space, in particular around the governance of ‘happenstance’ data, generated by individuals in the course of their daily activities.27 Trustworthy access to such data can help generate insights for public policy and research, enabling the government to better understand the impact of its policy interventions in rapidly-evolving circumstances. Their expertise in the collection and management of data means the Office for National Statistics is well-placed to lead the development of governance frameworks for these new data sources.Government should enhance their role inthis respect through the National Data Strategy and associated policy frameworks.

Making the UK the best place in the world to research and use AI requires it to be world-leading in the provision of responsive regulation and governance. While fundamental principles of good governance may be fixed and apply across sectors, the details will not, and this means that the systems of governance themselves need to be ready to respond and adapt more frequently than has typically been true of systems of governance in the past. We therefore suggest commissioning an independent entity to provide recommendations on the next steps in the evolution of governance mechanisms, including impact and risk assessments, best practice principles, ethical processes and institutional mechanisms that will increase and sustain public trust.Public trust in the applications of AI and algorithms depends on the trustworthiness of these applications and those that develop and implement these. Good governance also needs to encourage good culture amongst the individuals and organisations that are responsible for the development and application of advanced information technology. At the same time, the UK needs to continue investing in data- specific regulatory capacity and algorithmic accountability, ensuring that institutions are well funded to cover the advisory, enforcement and regulatory landscapes as sector digitalisation continues at pace. UK governance should combine sector-specific expertise with cross-sector insights, bringing regulators
in different sectors together to connect with each other and begin to experiment with new ways of encouraging safe AI innovation across and within their remit.Digital Twins and Living LabsApplying AI systems responsibly inevitably requires a great deal of development before getting anywhere near the physical world. Digital twins (a realistic representation of assets, processes, systems or institutions in the built, societal or natural environments) are increasingly recognised as important in many fields as they can provide insight into how complex physical assets and citizens behave in real time and can help organisations improve decision-making and optimising processes. An expanded programme to advance digital twin capability, with interoperable data standards, could help developers explore the potential for applications in the physical world but cheaper, faster and with less risk, as well as a better understanding of the implications and impacts to society and the economy. AI thrives when stitching digital twins together, using machine learning algorithms to analyse complex patterns and make decisions between different processes and systems alongside generating new insights with newly hybridised datasets.The National Digital Twin Programme, currently being driven by the Centre for Digital Built Britain, aims to create an Information Management Framework to

enable the building of digital twins across the built environment. Building on this work, a more ambitious cross-sectoral UK Digital Twin programme, governed by the Gemini Principles28, would be a moonshot challenge and would encourage more widespread use of open synthetic data to develop AI applications in many specific potential applications where the risks to individuals or society might otherwise be large. AI could also use these digital twins to explore real world optimisations that are beyond human scale.In developing those AI applications and AI models and testing with synthetic data, there comes a point when you must begin to model and rehearse in the real world with messy, unpredictable and diverse environments. To achieve this in a safe way without causing inadvertent harm, the UK needs to create a nationwide network of living laboratories, physical environments that start as representations of the real world but more constrained.AI will provide the embedded intelligence within all manner of new smart machines, many with autonomous capabilities, that can work collaboratively with humans to transform their productivity, safety and quality of life. By enabling the fast and safe development, testing and demonstration of new AI-based goods and services, including distributed software systems and intelligence embodied in smart machines and products, businesses, researchers and
citizens can gather the data and experience necessary to inform future policy, regulation, products and services.A globally leading roleFinally, the UK should urgently and sustainably build upon its strong international position. It is one of the top three countries in terms of research publications in AI.29 This strength combined with the UK’s diplomatic weight can be a catalyst to shape international discussions, but our leading international position is not guaranteed. We should therefore strengthen existing partnerships with other like-minded countries, such as France and Canada as well as consider carefully how to increase bilateral cooperation with countries like the US and China, such as through the recent declaration signed with the US to increase collaboration on AI R&D,30 to enable effective strategic action to shape a global AI landscape. One immediate way forward is to leverage our founding membership in the Global Partnership for AI (GPAI), a scalable club of like-minded governments ready to be led by experts on tackling the most pressing priorities for collaboration, where the UK is already leading on data governance.31The UK has a pivotal opportunity to play an influential role in the coming year as it adopts the Presidency of the G7 and the 26th UN Climate Change conference.Over this period the UK should use this opportunity to leverage global collective

Advancements in AI products and services underpin the capacity to compete economically but is also the domain of contests between overseas power bases and other nation states, which are sometimes not well aligned to the UK interest. One way to respond to this shift in geopolitical context is to invest strategically in research, development and innovation, choosing areas of national strengths such as AI and supporting them heavily with the aim of becoming globally competitive.If we align this strategic investment with the construction of broad coalitions of interest on the global stage, the UK can increase our sovereign capabilities and attract researchers and technologists with the skills to develop leading products in a number of competitive sectors. Government should also consider how to redefine procurement and intellectual property to encourage a creative technology ecosystem to achieve these aims.
DATA, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUBLIC TRUST	27
4. National, Cross-sector Adoption
The preceding sections outline the pillars that would provide the basis for sustained uptake of AI across the country and the economy as a whole.This section proposes transitional and other more specific measures to boost initial take up and to evolve existing markets in the crucial areas of business adoption, startup & scale-up support, public sector adoption, health and social care, climate change, and defence.Business as smart adoptersAcross society and the economy, and since the first weeks of 2020, the COVID- 19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital systems such as e- commerce platforms and marketplaces, and tools to enable remote working. The UK therefore has an opportunity to build on this momentum to showcase and reward the uptake of AI by encouraging
further investment and enabling business, especially SMEs, to be smart consumers for AI systems.Creating confidence so that business customers increasingly seek out AI solutions, knowing that they will be able to get sound advice and robust products, is crucial. There is further need to build on grants to access impartial advice on how to use digital and AI solutions to help the growth of SMEs that have been exacerbated by the COVID crisis.Scotland’s Data Lab is a good example of an initiative that fosters trusted collaboration between industry and AI expertise, having invested in 120 Collaborative Innovation Projects at approximately £12 million value over the last 5 years, and recently launched a Torch Business Advisory Service to support SMEs on their data journey.
29
The largest companies that are able to realise the potential of AI through business transformation find themselves increasing productivity, reducing costs and innovating faster to remain competitive. By ensuring the enabling foundations described in the first 10 recommendations are in place, the UK can also be a fertile ground for its existing FTSE 100 and the future 100.Supporting high growth AI startupsAs these businesses initiatives stimulate demand for AI products, we need to ensure that the AI startup and scaleup vendor ecosystem thrives. Supporting AI- first businesses by providing the necessary physical infrastructure to offer services to the largest and smallest local and multinational companies would help these businesses scale, develop and become the next multi billion dollar companies.The government should encourage more initiatives like Tech Nation’s Applied AI Program32 to directly support smaller startups to grow across the UK. The community welcomed an additional £200 million from the British Business Bank which increased VC funding to high growth companies,33 and there is a compelling argument to increase this funding, or alternatively to consider public investment in promising companies that seek to advance government priorities in a similar style to the National Security Strategic Investment Fund. For scaleups,
the funding gap that exists at series B+ means that AI companies struggle to stay under UK ownership. Government may consider supporting at this stage to ensure companies can take foreign investments in these rounds while also staying in the UK as they grow.The UK government needs to assist startups and scaleups to compete most effectively for the best talent. The Study Visa program may need to be extended now we have left the European Union. To this end, there is a prominent role for the government to position the UK as the go- to AI startup location in the region. It’s important to spread the message that the UK has more capital and talent than anywhere else34 and a unique proximity of buyer to vendor as well as being far easier to incorporate and run a business here than in Europe.To increase the number of SMEs and build the right entrepreneurial infrastructure for AI-first companies, it is also worth exploring the possibility of building on Innovate UK’s Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), in which the government could introduce a series of AI-specific KTPs to stimulate market ready AI research in areas of direct relevance to businesses to commercialise research.The UK currently lacks a prominent cohort of professionals who understand the complex sales and leadership skills needed to build, articulate and sell AI tools and develop leaders of AI research labs, and there is concurrently a specific

demand to increase the number of skilled product managers in AI. We recommend a marketing campaign and programs to encourage international product managers to come to the UK, and for UK citizens to focus their education or re-skilling in this direction. This would help turbo charge the UK’s ability to effectively commercialise the world class research coming out of our universities.Enabling public sector adoptionThe UK public sector will be a priority area when it comes to AI innovation. Improving policy-making processes (for example, ensuring it is more resilient to shocks to the system), and the provision of more efficient and effective public services (for example, using data-driven ‘real-time’ economic forecasts), built on strong ethical foundations, will become essential to improve the security and well-being of citizens.There is an urgent need to have a digitally and data enabled local and national government. To leverage the opportunities of AI in the public sector, there will need to be new ways of ensuring that data can be accessed and evaluated across public sector organisations. The government should ensure there is a central place for civil servants to access information about all of the AI-based tools and projects being undertaken across departments. AI should be used in projects that are outcome-based and only where
absolutely appropriate, and departments should learn rapidly from each other about what works well and what needs to evolve. In time, the focus should be on linking public sector data with private sector data, rapidly enhancing the insights that can be gained through diverse datasets and a more sophisticated adoption of AI.35Government should fund interdisciplinary pathfinder projects – requiring collaboration between industries and across government departments, with different academic disciplines – as a means of demonstrating the potential of AI technologies to support pathfinder projects and building capability in the civil service to deliver such projects.Importantly, the application of AI in the public sector should not fall explicitly on one department to lead. It may be that a Chief Information Officer embedded in the heart of government would work well to provide the strategic direction and leadership required for such a multi- stakeholder task.The huge benefits of data sharing will be worth little unless government departments are enabled to intelligently procure products that suit different contexts and services. More work is needed to demystify algorithmic decision making in government, with training programs for officials so they can suitably assess AI systems for themselves and see how it would be deployed as part of an increasingly efficient civil service. The ONS is working towards a target of 500

data analysts across government trained in data science techniques this year,36 and to enable a more thorough upskilling of AI and machine learning analysis, work should intertwine with the Turing, the Royal Society, the Royal Statistical Society and others in determining how data science and AI practitioners may be professionally standardised.Public sector bodies wishing to adopt AI often face challenges in building procurement capability. Governments have tried to enable public procurement to better support innovative goods and services, while ensuring value for money and relatively low risk. This government should continue to build on initiatives that have worked, such as GovTech and the guidelines for AI procurement,37 to allow the public sector to effectively purchase emerging tech such as AI. Greater AI adoption in the public sector through public sector procurement creates markets for data science and AI technologies to be developed, tested and deployed by government departments, to enable a pull-through of innovation from research, often via SMEs.It is important to note that evidence shows the human rights of the poorest and most vulnerable are especially at risk when public services are automated.38 As such we suggest this work is done carefully and with independent ethics
committees tasked to consider ethics, including social and economic impacts.Health and social careThe demands on healthcare are changing rapidly as populations drift, age, and their needs evolve, and with a huge reduction in the cost of measurement. With this ubiquity of such data, informed and improved interventions through prioritisation and personalisation can maximise benefit.Given the social and economic importance of health and the UK’s potential to build on market opportunities created by the NHS, the sector has been, and should continue to be, at the forefront of AI adoption. The importance of the link between health, mental health and social care has been especially clear during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have also seen areas in which AI could have been better prepared to deal with that link if we had considered the promise of AI in this sector earlier. AI can help manage the complex information flow that is needed for the integration of these systems. NHSX, in delivering the Health Secretary’s Tech Vision39, is taking the lead in unblocking issues including (but not limited to) governance, data access and protection, and inclusion. The Council, who are supporting NHSX with their AI Lab40 and AI Awards,41 looks to NHSX to work with others across the research,
35 There is a fundamental need to consider transparency and data bias as public sector adoption increases, taking into account analysis and recommendations from, among others: Review on Artificial Intelligence and Public Standards, The Committee on Standards in Public Life (February 2020); CDEI review into bias in algorithmic decision-making, Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (November 2020)36 Looking to the future at the Data Science Campus, Office for National Statistics (March 2019)37 Guidelines for AI Procurement, UK Government ( June 2020).

development and innovation landscape to continue building towards these opportunities and developing best practice guidance for AI adoption in the healthcare sector.As the adoption of AI increases outside of the hospital setting, so too will the ‘datafication’ of networked digital technologies which create new health insights for individuals. This carries abundant opportunities for the preventative health of citizens, for example in stimulating new and more efficient ways to diagnose and prevent disease beyond clinical boundaries, but there are also significant concerns if not governed correctly. Individuals’ health quickly becomes legible to actors outside medical and clinical settings, for example inferred sensitive personal information held by online platforms, and appropriate oversight ought to be considered in how these technologies develop.We also encourage further development in areas with others in the sector where the UK can build a competitive advantage. Three particular areas stand out: the first is in creating a data strategy for health and care, which achieves clean, codified and real-time data with a strong sectoral data governance framework. The second is the opportunity to develop new models of partnership and incentives for partnerships between SMEs and the NHS that flourish and scale beyond ideation.The third opportunity would be to create a better understanding of the skills and knowledge required for citizens and
healthcare professionals living and working with AI technologies, building especially on the Topol review42 and NHS Digital Academy.Finally, building on the UK’s world-leading life sciences industry and increasingly digitally mature NHS, there is an opportunity to establish the UK as thego-to-place for biomedical research. With the appropriate governance in place, and through closer collaboration of the life sciences industry and the NHS, AI has the potential to empower large national trials more efficiently, including through the seamless adaptation of subjects to treatments.Climate changeAI technologies are an essential part of the toolbox for innovating to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and to reduce the environmental impacts of goods, services and human activities. We are already seeing AI contributing to a greater grasp of complex environmental and sustainability systems, from forecasting supply and demand at real- time43 to combating illegal deforestation44 and understanding Arctic sea ice loss.45 One way to accelerate the use of AI for these purposes would be to build it into relevant moonshots, such as that on new materials for energy storage and renewables and create incentives for AI companies to address these and other Net Zero challenges.

The challenges to increased adoption of AI in related sectors, particularly in energy, has been explored elsewhere46 but echo similar constraints in other sectors, notably in the accessibility, interoperability and labelling of datasets that can contribute to cross-sector cooperation on energy and climate initiatives. The reality is also that the continued development of digital technologies, including AI and complementary technologies such as 5G and the Internet of Things, create an environmental impact that also needs to be monitored.As a part of the UK’s globally leading role in AI, there is an opportunity to carve out a leading path on the global stage where others see a similar need to increase the role of AI in energy and climate for public good. The UK should consider drawing up a plan that ensures responsible AI is suitable for the planet and helps build broader awareness, inform regulation, and incentivise researchers and developers to make more conscious and accountable decisions in these areas.Ahead of COP26, the UK should consider how to develop and showcase the UK’s ability in cleantech, which spans the entire country and represents a successful, innovative path to Net Zero,47 and use its spotlight to encourage an open, international digital ecosystem of data, algorithms and insights that can generate
reliable information in real-time about the state of the environment and interactions between the economy, society and the environment.Defence and securityAI is central to a broad range of defence and security applications, which are becoming increasingly data rich and networked. They require multiple sources of information to be brought together to understand a rapidly evolving situation, to determine a timely course of action and to oversee the enactment of the response. The information involved is often multi-modal (text, audio and video) and is invariably uncertain, incomplete and contradictory. Sometimes it is also intentionally misleading. AI methods are necessary to make sense of this volume, variety and velocity of information.However, further developments arerequired to scale the underpinning fusion techniques, to have them work in closer partnership with the humans involved, and to ensure the ensuing decisions and plans can be understood and justified.The increased connectivity of all aspects of our society means that digital assets are increasingly common, and valuable and physical assets are increasingly accessible remotely. These bring tremendous benefits, but also open up

opportunities for interference and disruption, leading to a requirement for a secure, connected intelligence. AI techniques are necessary to monitor the complexity of these networked systems and to determine when they are operating normally and when they are not. As cyber-attacks become increasingly sophisticated, AI is needed to detect and respond to them.We welcome the commitment to create a new MOD agency for AI, and look forward to further detail in the Integrated Review in 2021.We are now living in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment in which global tech companies hold sway over national strategic advantages. By strengthening our ties with like- minded nations, the UK can increase our capabilities in co-creating technological developments, drawing innovations from oblique application areas and developing leading products which are then adopted by our allies. The broader AI community will be required to engage in this space as the security sector becomes more pervasive, and the government will need to find ways of working across demanding security frameworks to enable wider collaboration.Part of opening up wider collaboration on this front will require new levels of internationally competitive investment in advanced hardware technologies that serve the UK ecosystem, as the driving force behind fast and secure innovation.
Co-creation – at scale – of technological developments in an application agnostic environment (benefiting from innovations from other application areas) could be a potential model. This would also provide additional benefits to improved technological export capabilities for Britain, and further benefits to attracting world-class technologists and innovators in this space, not seen in Britain since the 1980s.

Ministerial forewordViscount Camrose, Minister for AI and Intellectual PropertyArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a vital technology for the UK economy and for supporting people’s everyday lives. AI is enabling organisations to provide better services to customers and offer people quicker access to information. The UK AI market is predicted to grow to over $1 trillion by 2035 and we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the relentless improvements in AI capabilities. As adoption continues to grow across society, we must ensure that end-users are protected from cyber security risks. This is essential when so many other AI risks stem from an insecure system.Organisations in the UK face a complex cyber security landscape and we want to ensure that they have the confidence to adopt AI into their infrastructure. Currently, 47% of organisations who use AI do not have any specific AI cyber security practices or processes in place. It is therefore imperative that we ensure that AI is designed, developed, deployed and maintained securely.AI is identified in the UK’s National Cyber Strategy as a technology vital to cyber power and is listed as a critical technology in the UK’s Science and Technology Framework. This work on the cyber security of AI sits alongside wider government world-leading efforts to ensure the benefits of AI can be realised safely and securely. This includes hosting the world’s first AI Safety Summit in 2023; establishing the AI Safety Institute, the first government-backed organisation of its kind; and being the first government to publish an assessment of advanced AI’s capabilities and risks. Successful collaboration with our international partners will continue to underpin everything that we are doing on AI safety and security.As is the case for other areas of technology, from consumer ‘internet of things’ products to semiconductors, the UK advocates a secure by design approach. It is imperative that developers of software, including AI, are building security into the design process as well as across the entire lifecycle. In line with our approach, our work in this space is critical to set baseline cyber security requirements and ensure that these are adopted across the software and AI supply chain.I am therefore pleased to introduce this Call for Views on the Cyber Security of AI and a separate Call for Views on Software Resilience as a continuation of the UK’s leadership in this area. The government is proposing to take forward a two-part intervention on AI in the form of a voluntary Code of Practice that will be taken into a global standards development organisation for further development and sets baseline security requirements for stakeholders in the AI supply chain. Outputs from both these Call for Views will drive improved security behaviour across the software supply chain and increase confidence in organisations who adopt software products and services.Your engagement with this Call for Views will help the government develop and take-forward efforts to build a safer UK, where we can all benefit from AI. It will also support our ongoing work with industry and international partners because we recognise international alignment is crucial for this area. I look forward to continuing discussions on how the government, international partners, industry and civil society should collaborate and prioritise efforts to secure AI. Thank you for your contribution to this critical and generation-defining technology
area.Viscount CamroseParliamentary Under Secretary of StateDepartment for Science, Innovation and TechnologyExecutive summaryAI is transforming our daily lives. As the technology continues to evolve and be embedded, it is crucial that we ensure cyber security is a key underpinning of AI safety. This Call for Views sets out specific interventions to help secure AI, so that the many benefits of AI can be realised.This work has primarily focused specifically on the cyber security risks to AI, rather than wider issues such as safety or the cyber security risks that stem from AI. This work is relevant to all AI technologies, regardless of the sector in which AI is used or the form of AI technology, because security is an essential component and should be considered across the entire AI lifecycle. This work sits alongside wider government activity on AI, much of which is noted in the AI regulation white paper response (see Chapter 2).The government is proposing to take forward a two-part intervention in the form of a voluntary Code of Practice that will be taken into a global standards development organisation for further development. The proposed voluntary Code sets baseline security requirements for all AI technologies and distinguishes actions that need to be taken by different stakeholders across the AI supply chain.The voluntary Code of Practice was developed by the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT) and is based on the National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) Guidelines for secure AI system development which were published in November 2023, alongside the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other international cyber partners. The guidelines were co-sealed by agencies from 18 countries. The voluntary Code has also been informed by research we commissioned, including a risk assessment and a mapping of cyber security research in this area. Stakeholder engagement is a key component of our approach and will continue to be embedded throughout this Call for Views process and beyond.We want to enable AI developers to be able to distinguish themselves from their competitors by highlighting their commitment to security. We also recognise the importance of developing international alignment and ensuring that stakeholders that make up the AI supply chain have a clear understanding of what they need to implement. To that end, we’ve been engaging closely with international partners and mapped recommendations by industry and other governments to ensure this document sits in support of their efforts. We are also involved in various standards development organisations and multilateral fora to promote the need for security as part of discussions on AI (see Annex B).This publication is intended as the starting point of a much more extensive dialogue with our stakeholders, including industry and international partners. The cyber security of AI requires a global approach, as the risks cross international borders, and so international engagement has been a key element of our approach. We are now holding a Call for Views for 12 weeks until 9 August 2024 to gather feedback on the proposed interventions, including the Code of Practice and the intention to develop a global standard. The feedback will be used to inform UK government policy and our next steps.1: IntroductionBackground1.1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a part of our daily lives and is used by organisations and individuals as a powerful tool to enhance the way we work, interact with data and achieve outcomes. As developers of AI continue to push the boundaries of what models and systems can achieve, it is imperative we address the risks AI presents so that we can continue to unlock the opportunities it offers.[footnote 1]1.2 In the UK, we are already seeing the vast benefits of AI. The UK is home to the third largest number of AI unicorns and start-ups in the world[footnote 2] and the AI industry in the UK employs over 50,000 people while contributing £3.7 billion to the economy.[footnote 3] AI is also bringing innovation to many sectors, such astransport, agriculture and crime prevention by helping to: detect fraud through machine learning algorithms that can identify suspicious transactions in real time;[footnote4]
 improve organisations cyber security practices through the detection of threats.[footnote 6]1.3 As with any technology, the continued evolution and uptake of AI will also present challenges. To address these challenges, the government set out its pro-innovation and pro-safety regulatory framework, which will ensure that we are able to maximise the opportunities and minimise the risks of this fast-moving technology. The AI regulation white paper outlined five cross-sectoral principles to be applied by existing UK regulators, and a new central function to bring coherence and address regulatory gaps.[footnote 7]1.4 One of the five key principles of the framework is Safety, Security and Robustness. This means that AI systems should function in a robust, secure and safe way throughout the AI lifecycle, and risks should be continually identified, assessed and managed. To achieve this, we need to support developers and deployers of AI systems in addressing cyber security risks to their systems, which in turn will protect users of AI, and strengthen public trust.1.5 This is vital because cyber security is an essential precondition for the safety of AI systems and is required to ensure, amongst other things, privacy, reliability, and the secure use of models.1.6 It is imperative that we work towards a global solution for addressing the risks to AI models and systems. This requires a focus on collaborating with international partners to achieve consensus on baseline security requirements (see Annex B for further information on the international landscape).1.7 To complement international efforts to drive the adoption of cyber security in AI, we have set out in this document a proposed two-part intervention (Chapter 3) to create, firstly, a voluntary Code of Practice, that will then be used as the basis for the development of a global technical standard. This approach will focus on developing international alignment on baseline security requirements for AI models and systems.Scope1.8 This Call for Views is focused on addressing the cyber security risks to AI rather than wider issues relating to AI, such as safety or the cyber security risks that stem from AI. There is specific work on these areas being led by other parts of government (see the AI regulation white paper response for more details).[footnote 8]1.9 Security is an essential component underpinning all types of AI. Therefore, the scope of this Call for Views as well as the voluntary Code of Practice and proposed technical standard, includes all AI technologies, including frontier AI. We have ensured that this work aligns with other parts of government that are examining and addressing the risks associated with frontier AI. This reflects the scope of the AI Safety Summit 2023, the AI regulation white paper and the discussion paper on Frontier AI: Capabilities and Risks.1.10 We have also focused on the entire AI lifecycle because vulnerabilities in AI systems are not constrained to just one phase of the AI system. We have included below a diagram taken from the risk assessment that DSIT commissioned as an illustration of the different parts of the lifecycle process for creating an AI system.[footnote 9]Rationale1.11 As part of the Government’s commitment to deliver the National Cyber Strategy, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) has undertaken extensive work with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to make AI systems more secure. This work should also be viewed within the context of the Government’s wider ambitions to make the United Kingdom a global AI superpower, as set out in the National AI Strategy.1.12 We advocate a secure by design approach across all digital technologies which places the responsibility on those that develop technology to build robust security into their systems (further detail on this approach is set out in Chapter 2). Millions of people and organisations are using AI models every day to access better services and information. We must ensure that these models and systems are deployed with security built in by design. Without security, the continued rapid adoption and embedding of AI will result in vulnerabilities being widespread with implications for users and their data, as well as possible national security issues if services relying on AI were compromised or became unavailable.1.13 We will continue to be actively involved in multilateral initiatives such as the G7, G20, OECD and UN. It is vital that cyber security is a core part of any international agreements and discussions among governments and other stakeholders. Further details on this can be found within Annex B. Our research and work on the voluntary Code of Practice will inform these multilateral discussions.1.14 We recognise the value of global technical standards in promoting good practices in cyber security. Technical standards developed through a consensus-based multi-stakeholder standards development process promote global interoperability and ensure stakeholders have alignment for baseline cyber security requirements.1.1 
1.15 We recognise that work on technical standards relating to AI is underway within multiple global standards development organisations and there is currently a limited focus on baseline security requirements for AI which must be addressed.[footnote 10] Further details on our proposed approach involving the development of technical standards can be found in Chapter 3.1.16 The UK is well positioned to drive forward these crucial discussions within international fora and in global standard development organisations because the UK has consistently demonstrated leadership in championing and developing cyber security for emerging technologies (detailed in Chapter 2). Our approach and proposed interventions have been determined by a comprehensive evidence base. We have also conducted a multi- stakeholder approach to ensure that our proposals are tested thoroughly with experts. This process within the context of AI is set out in more detail below.Methodology1.16 Our work has focused on three areas: Identifying and evaluating the cyber security vulnerabilities and risks to AI. Identifying and evaluating what research and recommendations have been published on addressing the cyber security risks to AI (this informed the development of policy options set out in Annex E). Understanding business attitudes towards adopting AI, their views on what is expected from AI developers and their cyber security approach for protecting their infrastructure within the context of AI.1.17 The content in this Call for Views is supported by various research studies commissioned by DSIT that form part of our robust evidence base. Alongside this Call for Views, we are publishing: a mapping of existing research on the cyber security of AI; a risk assessment of vulnerabilities across the AI lifecycle and how they could be exploited by malicious actors; and a business survey of 350 UK organisations to understand the cyber security processes organisations are implementing for AI technologies. Through this research we are ensuring that our proposed interventions are based on data and can meaningfully address the cyber security risks to AI.Further detail on our research is set out in Annex A.[footnote 11]1.18 In light of the various work being undertaken internationally, we have engaged with international partners, experts within standards development organisations, as well as other stakeholder groups, to ensure our work was thoroughly tested and complements wider international activity. We commissioned a further literature review which mapped both technical and general recommendations made by industry and other governments. This ensured that publications by the international community informed the development of the Code of Practice, and the requirements were written in the context of various initiatives (further detail can be found in Chapter 3 and Annex F).1.19 This Call for Views is the start of further dialogue with industry and international partners to ensure that users can securely benefit from AI. This work should be viewed in the broader scope of the Government’s initiatives in cyber security. The subsequent section offers a summary of various related Government activity linked to AI and cyber security.2: Our technology security programme2.1 All cyber security Codes of Practice produced by DSIT are part of the Government’s broader approach to improve baseline cyber security practices and cyber resilience across the UK. They sit alongside various other levers which have been used by the Government to deliver on the objectives of the current, as well as previous, National Cyber Strategies. The Codes of Practice provide guidance ranging from the development of baseline cyber security advice which all organisations should follow, moving progressively towards more product or domain-specific advice due to the increasing risk and evolving threat landscape. A modular approach has been developed to help organisations easily identify which Codes – and within those Codes, which provisions – arerelevant to them according to both their business functions, and the types of technologies they either use or manufacture.[footnote 12]2.2 In the case of the voluntary Code contained within this Call for Views, our expectation is that relevant organisations should, at a minimum, also adhere to the provisions in both the Software and Cyber Governance Codes of Practice. While the Cyber Governance Code of Practice sets the baseline expectations for all organisations using digital technologies, the Software Code will also be relevant since software is an integral part of how AI models and systems function. Organisations deemed in scope of this Code would also be expected to assess whether their circumstances warrant consideration of adherence to additional cyber Codes published by the UK Government which may cover specific products or services relevant to them.2.3 As noted above, this work on AI is closely linked to the Government’s recent publication on software resilience due to the inherent overlap between these technology areas. The Government previously held a Call for Views on software resilience and security for businesses and organisations in 2023. The feedback we received on the software resilience Call for Views highlighted the need for a voluntary Code of Practice that set2.1 
The UK’s Approach to Cyber Security2.4 The UK, as a global leader in cyber security, is committed to creating a safe online environment for its citizens. A foundational pillar of this approach is to ensure that both existing and emerging technologies are secure by design. By setting baseline cyber security expectations and incorporating them into the development of digital technologies at inception, we are laying the groundwork for efforts to safeguard users and businesses against evolving cyber threats, and to provide consumers with confidence in the technologies that they use. However, security also needs to be considered throughout the lifecycle of a technology, and the distinct security challenges presented by individual technologies need to be recognised and assessed.2.5 DSIT has led several initiatives that embed a “secure by design” approach, contributing to the UK’s strategic advantage and global cyber security leadership. These include: The creation of the world’s first mandatory and enforceable security requirements for consumer technology through the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure (PSTI) Act.[footnote 14] This work built on the UK’s Code of Practice for Consumer IoT, published in 2018. Delivering the world’s first App and App Store Privacy and Security Code of Practice, which is being implemented by all major app store operators.[footnote 15] Building on the Capability Hardware Enhanced Risk Introduction Set Computer (RISC) Instructions (CHERI) research from the University of Cambridge, we have worked with Arm to develop a processor prototype thatintegrates CHERI capabilities to enable fine-grained protection of memory. This forms part of our Digital Security by Design programme.[footnote 16]2.6 A secure by design approach is only the first step towards UK-wide cyber resilience. To build on this, we must also focus on cultivating the necessary cyber security skills. This entails aligning our cyber skills development initiatives more closely with the needs of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) sectors, the specific risks associated with new and emerging technologies which are being adopted, and with the resilience measures that we expect of organisations across the economy. In doing so, we are seeking to foster a skilled workforce capable of deploying the baseline cyber security expectations we set across diverse sectors of the economy.2.7 Another key part of building a more cyber resilient UK is identifying and mitigating cyber risks as they proliferate across digital supply chains. By providing guidance, we can help businesses and organisations better manage risks associated with the digital products and services on which they rely. Our work in this space includes: Cyber Essentials Certification, which is a Government backed scheme to certify that organisations have taken the minimum steps to protect themselves against the most common cyber attacks. The Cyber Assessment Framework, which supports organisations as they seek to assess cyber risks to essential functions. This is aimed at critical organisations such as those in CNI sectors. The Cyber Governance Code of Practice, which sets the baseline expectations for all organisations using digital technologies.2.8 Our ability to safeguard businesses and communities from cyber threats hinges upon our ability to both nurture technological and human capabilities, and to recognise and address complex risks on a macro scale. By prioritising secure by design, skill development, and targeted measures which improve resilience across all sectors of our economy, we seek to pave the way for a more secure cyber landscape in the UK.Supporting government activity on AI2.9 The work outlined in this Call for Views forms part of the Governments’ efforts to enable safe and trustworthy AI. An overview of the various activities being taken on AI can be found in the recently published AI regulation white paper response.[footnote 17] The response sets out how Government is implementing the regulatoryframework, including by preparing and upskilling the UK’s regulators, setting out the case for targeted binding measures on developers of highly capable general purpose AI systems, and preventing the misuse of AI technologies. We have set out below the key interlinking areas of work that are being taken forward within DSIT.2.10 The UK hosted the first AI Safety Summit in November 2023. Representatives from 28 nations, including the US, EU, and China endorsed the Bletchley Declaration, an ambitious agreement to support an internationally inclusive network of scientific research on advanced AI safety and ensure the benefits of technology can be harnessed for the good of all. Cyber security was an important aspect of the Summit and included in key documents such as the ‘Emerging processes for AI safety’ policy paper and the Bletchley Declaration itself.2.1 
2.11 During the Summit, the UK Government announced the creation of the AI Safety Institute (AISI), which will also be fundamental in informing the UK’s regulatory framework. AISI’s three core functions are to develop and conduct evaluations on advanced AI systems, drive foundational AI safety research and facilitate information exchange.2.12 The Summit also emphasised the importance of understanding the risks associated with AI and this work has sought to expand this area in collaboration with the activities being taken forward by the Central AI Risk Function (CAIRF). CAIRF brings together policymakers and AI experts with a mission to identify, assess, report on and prepare for AI associated risks on an ongoing basis. CAIRF will: Maintain a holistic view of risks across the AI ecosystem by monitoring current and emerging AI risks facing the UK and assessing their likelihood and impact. Report on AI risk to inform government intervention and regularly report assessments of risks and mitigations to Ministers and ensure coordination and interoperability with the National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA). Ensure that HMG can effectively respond to AI risks and issues if discovered.2.13 Data is the beating heart of AI and is the foundation for modelling, training and developing AI systems. Various functions across the UK government are taking a leading role in ensuring that AI and data can be used for good, safely. Our proposed Code of Practice and global standard will complement this work.[footnote 18]2.14 Our work on the cyber security of AI, which is the focus of this Call for Views, builds on existing and developing efforts to tackle risks stemming from the misuse of AI technologies. Taken together, this demonstrates the UK government’s ambition to ensure that the benefits of AI innovation can be realised safely and responsibly.3: Voluntary Code of Practice and Global Standard3.1 Based on the evidence available, set out in Annex A, we have determined that a two-part intervention based on a voluntary Code of Practice and a global standard will help address the cyber security risks to AI. Subject to feedback received, this will require finalising a voluntary Code of Practice and developing a global standardbased on this Code.[footnote 19]3.2 It is the Government’s intention, subject to the feedback of this consultation, to submit an updated voluntary Code of Practice to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in September 2024 to help inform the development of this global standard on baseline cyber security for AI systems and models. Taking the voluntary Code of Practice and research (outlined in 1.17) from this work into a standards organisation will ensure the future standard is of a high quality and informed by data and extensive global feedback.3.3 This Call for Views will only be the start of the process for stakeholders to contribute to this work. In addition to this Call for Views, we will continue to actively seek feedback and engagement as our work progresses. We also encourage stakeholders to participate in the standards development process, and to note that there will be a consultation phase for national standards bodies as part of ETSI’s typical standards development process.3.4 In addition to this Code of Practice, several other options (set out in Annex E) have been considered in support of the programme’s objectives. The Government created a criteria to assess the effectiveness of each policy option, including the voluntary Code of Practice and the creation of a global standard. Each intervention was tested to determine if it would address the issues raised from the evidence findings and promote baseline security practices in the development of AI models and systems.Rationale for a Code of Practice and global standard3.5 A key aim of the current and previous National Cyber Strategy has been to build international support for a “secure by design” approach as well as baseline security requirements across various areas of technology. [footnote 20] A Code of Practice and global standard would help achieve this objective (as set out in Chapter 1). Moreover;There are clear risks to AI and it is important that these are addressed so that millions of consumers and organisations can benefit from AI technologies. Baseline security requirements will help reduce the number of cyber attacks and therefore protect users’ data and the economy.Many organisations that are implementing, or considering adopting, AI do not have a clear understanding of what security expectations they should have from developers. A Code and technical standard will enable cyber security companies and certification firms to help companies with testing and assuring their products and services. This will enable users to more easily verify that the products they use are securely designed and developed, giving them greater confidence.We want to create a market ecosystem where AI supply chain stakeholders are looking to use security as a differentiator between their competitors. A technical global standard will help enhance an organisation’s
 We want to ensure the UK continues to be a leader in AI and that our market is prepared for further developments in AI. As part of this, we support the ambitions of AI developers to create more sophisticated models and systems and view cyber security as a key enabler of this. A voluntary Code and technical standard will ensure innovation and safety in AI can develop in tandem.AI Cyber Security Code of PracticeBackgroundThis proposed voluntary Code of Practice was developed by DSIT and is based on NCSC’s Guidelines for secure AI system development which were published in November 2023, alongside the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other international cyber partners. The Code has also been informed by an assessment of the cyber security risks to AI as well as a literature review that mapped accessible technical recommendations made by industry and other governments. The findings of the literature review have been used to map relevant publications to the Code’s principles to offer an indication of where there are crossovers.[footnote 21]The Code sets out practical steps for stakeholders across the AI supply chain, particularly Developers and System Operators, to protect end-users. The Code applies to all AI technologies and will help ensure that security is effectively built into AI models and systems as well as across the AI lifecycle. We have applied this broad scope because a lot of the complexity in an AI system resides out of the model, and there is a significant dependency on data. It is important for stakeholders to note that this voluntary Code sits in support of the UK Government’s wider efforts for AI and regulations, such as UK data protection law. Stakeholders across the AI supply chain must ensure that they comply with their regulatory obligations. Considering the direct interlinkage between data and security within the context of an AI model and system; both areas are addressed through the Code’s requirements.Our expectation is that organisations in scope would, at a minimum, also adhere to the provisions in both the Software and Cyber Governance Codes of Practice. While the Cyber Governance Code of Practice sets the baseline expectations for all organisations using digital technologies as part of their business function, the Software Code will also be relevant since software is an integral part of how AI models and systems function. Organisations deemed in scope of this Code would also be expected to assess whether their circumstances warrant consideration of adherence to additional Codes covering more specific products or services depending on their business function.Millions of businesses and consumers are using AI models and systems, and it is important that they, and the global economy, can benefit from the opportunities provided by AI. It is therefore essential that as new updates are rolled out and new products come to market, security is a core consideration throughout the AI lifecycle. The Code is intended to help inform the policy and practices that organisations currently have in place.Furthermore, we recognise that several industry and standards bodies, as well as other countries, have compiled recommendations to address the cyber security risks to AI. This voluntary Code of Practice is designed to be complementary to, and supportive of, those efforts. This is particularly important when working groups have been set up in various standards development organisations, including the Secure AI Technical Committee in the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).As set out in the Call for Views document, we are encouraging feedback from global stakeholders. This is because the Government’s intention, depending on the feedback received during the Call for Views, is to submit the updated voluntary Code to ETSI in September 2024 to help inform the development of a global standard.This Code will be reviewed, and if necessary updated, where there are changes in the technology itself, the risk landscape and the regulatory regimes.[footnote 22] We are therefore proposing monitoring and evaluation activitiesto assess uptake of the Code’s principles among key stakeholders (see Call for Views document – points 3.6 and 3.7).AudienceAn indication is given for each principle within this voluntary Code as to which stakeholder is primarily responsible for implementation. The stakeholders are defined as:Stakeholder	DefinitionsDevelopers	This encompasses any type of business or organisation across any sector as well as individuals that are responsible for creating an AI model and/or system. This applies to all AI technologies and both proprietary and open-source models. For context, a business or organisation that creates an AI model and who is also responsible for embedding/deploying that model/system in their organisation would be defined in this voluntary Code to be both a Developer and a System Operator.
System Operators
This includes any type of business or organisation across any sector that has responsibility for embedding / deploying an AI model and system within their infrastructure. This applies to all AI technologies and both proprietary and open-source models. This term also includes those businesses that provide a contractual service to organisations to embed / deploy an AI model and system for business purposes.

Data controllers
This includes any type of business, organisation or individual that control data permissions and the integrity of data that is used for any AI model or system to function. In the context of an AI system, there could be multiple data controllers involved because some data used to create a model could come from the organisation that is deploying/embedding the system in their infrastructure and other data could be from public databases and other sources.
End-users	This encompasses any employee within an organisation or business and UK consumers who use an AI model and system for any purpose, including to support their work and day-to-day activities. This applies to all AI technologies and both proprietary and open-source models. End- users are not expected or required to implement this Code. This stakeholder group has been created because the voluntary Code has placed expectations on Developers, System Operators and Data controllers to help inform and protect end-users.The table below gives examples of common cases involving different types of organisations that are relevant to this voluntary Code of Practice as well as the Software Resilience voluntary Code of Practice.Stakeholder Groups	Guidance
Software vendors who also offer AI services to customers/end-users
These organisations are a Developer and therefore are in scope of this Code and the Software Resilience Code of Practice.

Code of Practice PrinciplesSecure DesignPrinciple 1: Raise staff awareness of threats and risksPrimarily applies to: System Operators, Developers, and Data Controllers[NIST 2022, NIST 2023, ASD 2023, WEF 2024, OWASP 2024, MITRE 2024, Google 2023, ESLA 2023, Cisco2022, Deloitte 2023, Microsoft 2022]1.1. Organisations shall establish and maintain a continuous security awareness program to educate their staff about the evolving threat landscape specific to AI systems.1.1.1. The AI-Security security awareness content shall be reviewed and updated where necessary at least every six months.1.1.2. AI-specific security awareness training could be incorporated into existing infosec training for staff.1.2. Developer organisations should provide their staff with regular updates on the latest security threats and vulnerabilities that could impact AI systems1.2.1. These updates should be communicated through multiple channels, such as security bulletins, newsletters, or internal knowledge-sharing platforms, to ensure broad dissemination and understanding among the staff.1.3. Developers shall receive training in secure coding techniques specific to AI development, with a focus on preventing and mitigating security vulnerabilities in AI algorithms, models, and associated software.1.3.1 Developer training should also include content on how developers may leverage AI/LLMs to improve code security1.4 Developers shall receive awareness training in the characteristics of machine learning and AI systems in general that make them especially complex (and hence particularly vulnerable to technical debt and security issues) – these often include convoluted data dependencies, multi-layered software architectures, and intricate configurations.Principle 2: Design your system for security as well as functionality and performance[footnote 24]Primarily applies to: System Operator[OWASP 2024, MITRE 2024, WEF 2024, ENISA 2023, NCSC 2023, BSI1 2023, Cisco 2022, Microsoft 2022, G72023, HHS 2021, OpenAI2 2024, ASD 2023, ICO 2020]2.1 As part of deciding whether to create an AI system, a System Operator shall determine and document the business requirements and/or problem they are seeking to address.2.1.1 Data controllers shall be part of internal discussions when determining the requirements and data needs of an AI system.NCSC Guidelines for Secure AI System Development - other areas to consider include: The complexity of the model they are using, specifically the chosen architecture and number of parameters. The model’s chosen architecture and number of parameters will, among other factors, affect how much training data it requires and how robust it is to changes in input data when in use. The appropriateness of the model for their use case and/or feasibility of adapting it to their specific need (for example by fine-tuning). The ability to align, interpret and explain their model’s outputs (for example for debugging, audit or regulatory compliance); there may be benefits to using simpler, more transparent models over large and complex ones which are more difficult to interpret. The characteristics of training dataset(s), including size, integrity, quality, sensitivity, age, relevance and diversity the value of using model hardening (such as adversarial training), regularisation and/or privacy enhancing techniques. The provenance and supply chains of components including the model or foundation model, training data and associated tools. See NCSC Machine Learning Principles (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/machine-learning) for more information.2.2 To support the process of preparing data for an AI system, Developers shall document and audit trail the creation, operation, and life cycle management of models, datasets and prompts incorporated into the system.2.1 
2.3 If a Developer and/or System Operator decides to use an external Application Programming Interface (API), they shall apply appropriate controls to data that can be sent to services outside of their organisation’s control, such as requiring users to log in and confirm before sending potentially sensitive information.2.4 Data controllers shall ensure that the intended usage of the system is appropriate with the sensitivity of the data it was controlled on as well as the controls intended to ensure the safety of data.2.5 Where the AI system will be interacting with other systems, (be they internal or external), Developers and System Operators shall ensure that the permissions used by the system are only provided as required for functionality and are risk assessed.This includes ensuring identities used by the AI system are constrained in scope and privilege to the access required. This includes external AI and non-AI fail-safes if necessary.2.6 If a System Operator chooses to work with an external model provider, they shall undertake a due diligence assessment of that provider’s security.This assessment could involve implement scanning and isolation/sandboxing when importing third-party models, serialised weights or untrusted third-party code.2.7 If a Developer and/or System Operator decides to use an external library, they shall complete a due diligence assessment.[footnote 25]This assessment could consider whether the model can be obtained as a safe model and if not, then doing checks to ensure the library has controls that prevent the system loading untrusted models without immediately exposing itself to arbitrary code execution.Principle 3: Model the threats to your system[footnote 26]Primarily applies to: Developers and System Operators[OWASP 2024, WEF 2024, Nvidia 2023, ENISA 2023, Google 2023, G7 2023, NCSC 2023, Deloitte 2023]3.1 Developers and System Operators shall undertake modelling of the threats to a system as part of their risk management process.NCSC Guidelines for Secure AI System Development: This modelling could include understanding the potential impacts to all AI-responsible stakeholders, end-users, and wider society if an AI component becomes compromised or behaves unexpectedly. Additionally, the modelling could be informed by AI-specific attacks and failure modes, as well as more traditional IT system attacks. The modelling could factor the total range of possible outputs, (including worst case scenarios), from AI components and their impact on the system.3.1.1 The risk management process shall be conducted to address any security risks that arise when a new setting or configuration option is implemented at any stage of the AI lifecycle.3.1.2 As part of this process, Developers shall create a document that includes a list of adversarial motivations and possible attack routes in line with those motivations.The type of attacks could include indirect attacks where attackers poison data which might later be used by, or sent to, the model.3.1.3 Developers shall manage the risks associated with models that provide multiple functionality, where increased functionality leads to increased risk. For example, where a multi-modal model is being used but only single modality is used for system function.3.2 Data controllers should conduct a data protection impact assessment when necessary as a measure under UK data protection obligations to determine what controls are needed.3.3 Where threats are identified that cannot be resolved by Developers, this shall be communicated to System Operators and End-users to allow them to appropriately threat model their systems.3.4 Where third-party organisations have responsibility for risks identified within an organisations infrastructure, System Operators should attain assurance that these parties are able to address the risk.3.5 System Operators should seek to apply controls to risks identified through the analysis based on a range of considerations, including the cost of implementation in line with their corporate risk tolerance.3.6 Developers and System Operators should recognise and accept that a level of risk will remain despite the application of controls to mitigate against them, and continuously monitor and review their system infrastructure according to risk appetite.Principle 4: Ensure decisions on user interactions are informed by AI-specific risks[footnote 27]Primarily applies to: Developers and System Operators
[OWASP 2024, MITRE 2024, BSI1 2023, Microsoft 2022]4.1 Developers and System Operators shall ensure that their system provides effective safeguards around model outputs through non-AI components and processes.This could also include the use of trained human oversight.4.2 Developers shall take steps to validate that the designed controls specified by the Data Controller have been built into the system.4.3 Developers should consider placing limits on the rate of model access (e.g. via APIs) to prevent attacks based on experimentation, and limit resource usage for single model inputs to prevent the overuse of resources.4.4 Developers and System Operators should ensure end-users are aware of prohibited use cases of the AI system.4.5 Developers and System Operators should be transparent with end-users about known limitations or potential failure modes to protect against overreliance.4.6 If a Developer offers an API to external customers or collaborators, they shall apply appropriate controls that mitigate attacks on the AI system via the API.Secure DevelopmentPrinciple 5: Identify, track and protect your assets[footnote 28]Primarily applies to: Developers, System Operators and Data Controllers[OWASP 2024, Nvidia 2023, NCSC 2023, BSI1 2023, Cisco 2022, Deloitte 2023, Amazon 2023, G7 2023, ICO2020]5.1 Developers, Data Controllers and System Operators shall know where their assets reside and have assessed and accepted any associated risks as they evolve.These assets could include AI models, data (including user feedback), prompts, software, documentation, logs and assessments (including information about potentially unsafe capabilities and failure modes).5.2 Developers, Data Controllers and System Operators shall have processes and tools to track, authenticate, manage version control and secure their assets.5.3 System Operators shall have the ability to restore their systems to a known good state in the event of compromise.5.4 All responsible stakeholders in this Code shall take steps to protect sensitive data, such as training or test data, against unauthorised access (see 6.2 and 6.2.1 for details on securing your data and other assets).5.4.1 Developers, Data Controllers and System Operators shall apply checks and sanitisation to data and inputs when designing the model [based on their access to said data and inputs and where those data and inputs are stored]. This shall be repeated when model revisions are made in response to user feedback or continuous learning [See principle 6 for relevant provisions for open source].Principle 6: Secure your infrastructure[footnote 29]Primarily applies to: Developers and System Operators[OWASP 2024, MITRE 2024, WEF 2024, NCSC 2023, Microsoft 2022, ICO 2020]6.1 Alongside implementing essential cyber security practices for securing system infrastructure[footnote 30], Developers and System Operators shall adopt appropriate access controls to their APIs, models and data, and to their training and processing pipelines.[footnote 31]6.2 Developers and System Operators shall create segregated environments to enforce sensitivity and threat boundaries.6.2.1 Developers, System Operators and Data Controllers shall create segregated environments for storing critical data, such as sensitive, training or test data [where this training data is not based on publicly available data – see 7.3.1 and 7.3.2].6.2.2 Developers shall also create a segregated environment for where research is done and where production models are developed and/or accessed.Stakeholders could use containerisation and virtualisation as methods for segregation. See NCSC containerisation guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/using-containerisation (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/using-containerisation)6.3 Developers and System Operators shall implement and publish an effective vulnerability disclosure process6.1 
to support a transparent and open culture within the organisation.[footnote 32]6.4 Developers and System Operators shall create an incident management plan.Principle 7: Secure your supply chain[footnote 33]Primarily applies to: Developers, System Operators and Data Controllers [OWASP 2024, NCSC 2023, Microsoft 2022, ASD 2023]7.1 Developers and System Operators shall require suppliers to adhere to the same security expectations and requirements that they apply to other software components to develop new software/AI products. This shall align with their risk management policies.7.2 If a component is not produced in-house, Developers and System Operators should acquire and maintain well-secured and well-documented hardware and software components (for example, models, data, software libraries, modules, middleware, frameworks, and external APIs) from verified commercial, open-source, and other third-party developers to ensure robust security in your systems.7.2.1 Developers that choose to use any models, or components, which are not well-documented or secured shall be able to justify why, (for example if there was no other supplier for said component), and be prepared to share this explanation with end-users, and System Operators if required.Particular attention should be given to the use of open-source models, where the responsibility of model maintenance and security becomes complex.7.3 Developers and System Operators should be prepared to failover to alternate solutions for mission-critical systems, if their security criteria are not met.[footnote 34]7.3.1 Where training data has been sourced from publicly available sources, Developers and Data controllers shall need to validate that such training data will not compromise the integrity of their security protocols.7.3.2 Data controllers should continually monitor the source of publicly available data that could be used for creating a model, such as for changes in the data sources that may risk creating vulnerabilities.Principle 8: Document your data, models and prompts[footnote 35]Primarily applies to: Developers[OWASP 2024, WEF 2024, NCSC 2023, Cisco 2022, Microsoft 2022, ICO 2020]8.1 Developers shall document and maintain a clear audit trail of their model design and post-deployment maintenance plans.8.1.1 Developers should ensure that the document includes security-relevant information, such as the sources of training data (including fine-tuning data and human or other operational feedback), intended scope and limitations, guardrails, cryptographic hashes or signatures, retention time, suggested review frequency and potential failure modes.8.1.2 Developers should pay particular attention to document areas of model and system complexity that could lead to unexpected security issues, including details of software dependencies and configurations.8.2 Developers should ensure that model outputs include only the necessary information for downstream purposes and do not include additional meta-data that might be used for honing attacks against the model.Principle 9: Conduct appropriate testing and evaluation[footnote 36]Primarily applies to: Developers[OWASP 2024, WEF 2024, Nvidia 2023, NCSC 2023, ENISA 2023, Google 2023, G7 2023]9.1 Developers shall ensure that no models, applications or systems are released that haven’t been tested as part of a security assessment process.9.2 Developers shall validate that AI models perform as intended through testing.9.2.1 Developers shall work closely with System Operators for post-deployment testing when maintaining a system. (see 2.1.2 for more details)9.2.2 Evaluations of AI systems should involve red teaming or other adversarial testing as part of a whole system approach.9.2.3 Evaluations of AI systems should be undertaken by suitably skilled testers. Where possible, this should be an independent external evaluation.9.1.1 
9.3 Developers should perform benchmarking as part of their risk management process throughout the AI development lifecycle (see principle 2 for more detail).9.4 Developers should ensure that the findings from the testing and evaluation are shared with System Operators, to inform their own testing and evaluation.Secure DeploymentPrinciple 10: Communication and processes associated with end-users[footnote 37]Primarily applies to: Developers and System Operators10.1 In the context of AI, Developers shall state clearly to end-users (where possible) which aspects of security the end-user is responsible for and are transparent about where and how their data might be used, accessed or stored (for example, if it is used for model retraining, or reviewed by employees or partners).10.2 Developers should ensure that the organisation proactively supports affected End-users and System Operators during and following a cyber security incident to contain and mitigate the impacts of an incident. The process for undertaking this should be documented and agreed in contracts with end-users.10.3 Developers should provide end-users with guidance on how to use, manage, integrate, and configure the software product or service securely.10.3.1 In the context of AI, this should include the appropriate use of your model or system, which includes highlighting limitations and potential failure modes.10.3.2 Moreover, Developers shall inform end-users of additional AI model functionality, and allow an opt-out option.Secure MaintenancePrinciple 11: Maintain regular security updates for AI model and systems[footnote 38]Primarily applies to: Developers and System Operators [ICO 2020]11.1 Developers and System Operators shall ensure that when documenting their project requirements, their plans include conducting regular security audits and updates and working with external providers (where needed) to achieve this.11.2 Developers shall provide security updates and patches, where possible, and notify System Operators and End-users of the security updates.11.2.1 In instances where updates can’t be provided, Developers shall have mechanisms for escalating issues to the wider community, particularly customers and other Developers.To help deliver this, they could publish bulletins responding to vulnerability disclosures, including detailed and complete common vulnerability enumeration.11.3 Developers should treat major system updates as though a new version of a model has been developed, and therefore undertake a new testing and evaluation process for each to help protect users.11.4 Developers should support System Operators to evaluate and respond to model changes, (for example by providing preview access via beta-testing and versioned APIs).Principle 12: Monitor your system’s behaviour Primarily applies to: Developers and System Operators[OWASP 2024, WEF 2024, Nvidia 2023, ENISA 2023, BSI1 2023, Cisco 2022, Deloitte 2023, G7 2023, Amazon2023, ICO 2020]12.1 In line with privacy and data protection requirements, Systems Operators should log all inputs and outputs to/from their AI system to enable auditing, compliance obligations, investigation and remediation in the case of compromise or misuse.12.2 System Operators and Developers should also consider logging internal states of their AI models where they feel this could better enable them to address security threats, or to enable future security analytics.12.3 System Operators and Developers should monitor the performance of their models and system over time so that they can detect sudden or gradual changes in behaviour that could affect security.This can be achieved by using tools that detect anomalous inputs that will skew outputs, without knowing what malicious input looks like. There are specific methods that could be implemented to mitigate input that is out of distribution or invalid, such as outlier detection, anomaly detection, novelty detection, and open set recognition.
12.4 System Operators and Developers should analyse their logs to ensure that AI models continue to produce desired outputs over time.Monitoring and Evaluation3.6 The Code has been designed in line with our pro-innovation approach. Our intention is to allow flexibility via a principles-based approach when implementing the provisions and adaptation overtime as the area develops to reduce the burden on stakeholders in the AI supply chain. Further details on its scope and the stakeholders that must adhere to it can be found within the Code.3.7 The proposed Code of Practice would be voluntary; however, we will continue to work closely with interested stakeholders to determine if regulatory action is needed for AI in the future. To help support this, the Government’s intention is to undertake monitoring and evaluation uptake of the Code and its effectiveness at encouraging the outcomes that we hope to see in the AI ecosystem.4: How to respond to the Call for Views and our next steps4.1 DSIT will be holding an 12-week Call for Views on the document from 15 May to 9 August 2024. Stakeholders are invited to provide specific feedback on the interventions and make recommendations regarding other policy options via an online survey form. Please see Annex D for the full Call for Views Survey Questionnaire. We encourage stakeholders, particularly in the AI supply chain, to provide data on the financial and wider impacts associated with the implementation of the Government’s proposed interventions. All data will be treated confidentially, and participants will have the opportunity to identify themselves when they submit their responses or to be anonymous.4.2 During the Call for Views, DSIT will be organising workshops with industry bodies and holding meetings with international counterparts as part of our efforts to promote this work. We are also planning to attend UK and international conferences, including on specific panels so that we can present our approach to a global audience. If you would like to bring any related events/conferences to our attention or if you have any questions on the online survey please contact AIcybersecurity@dsit.gov.uk (by 9 August 2024). You can also submit written comments to the AI Cyber Security Call for Views, Secure Code and Standards, Cyber Security & Digital Identity Directorate, Department for Science, Innovation & Technology, Level 4, 100 Parliament Street, Westminster, London, SW1A 2BQ. DSIT plans to arrange workshops with industry to help gather feedback.4.3 Following the Call for Views, we will review the feedback provided. We plan to publish a response which provides an overview of the key themes from the Call for Views and DSIT’s future direction of travel. If there is support for a global technical standard, we will look to take this forward alongside increasing our participation across global standard development organisations.Annex A: Research findingsOverview of research studies and objectivesThe research field of AI Security is still nascent and has developed for the last 5 years. DSIT has commissioned targeted research to establish an initial evidence base to inform the development of our policy interventions, notably the Code of Practice.[footnote 39]The specific studies involved:An assessment of the cyber security risks to AI (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-on-the-cyber- security-of-ai/cyber-security-risks-to-artificial-intelligence) by Grant Thornton and Manchester Metropolitan University was completed in February 2024.A survey of 350 UK businesses to understand how org anisations are approaching AI (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-on-the-cyber-security-of-ai/ai-cyber-security-survey-main-report), particularly regarding cyber security. The survey was conducted by IFF Research and ran from January to February 2024.A literature review mapping the technical and policy recommendations made by industry and other governments. This was completed in February 2024, conducted by Professor Peter Garraghan of Mindgard, using information published since 2020.[footnote 40]A literature review of research on the cyber security of AI
(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/663cf1b2bd01f5ed3279388e/Study_of_research_and_guidance_on_the_c yber_security_of_AI_-_Queens_University_Belfast_literature_review.pdf) involving an in-depth analysis of more than 415 publications, completed in February 2024 by Queen’s University Belfast.The key findings from the research are outlined below. The vulnerabilities and threats across various AI technologies are broadly similar to each other. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in an AI system can have a substantial impact on end-users, such as the loss of sensitive data linked to consumers and employees as well as providing malicious actors with a way of breaching an organisation’s infrastructure. Organisations generally lack awareness and understanding of what security should be built into models and systems and whether practices/processes should be in place when adopting AI to protect their organisations. Key organisations, governments and standards development organisations advocate for security requirements for AI models and systems. Vulnerabilities found in AI systems can enable the models and systems to be weaponised which can result in cyber attacks and significant harms on users.[footnote 41] The majority of the research conducted in the field of the Security of AI is being conducted by academic institutions. Out of the 415 sources on the cyber security of AI fully analysed by Queens University Belfast, only 28% were created by industry organisations.Threats to AI technologiesThe assessment of the cyber security risks to AI was commissioned to provide DSIT with an up-to-date analysis of the risk landscape of AI technologies. The assessment was formed from the findings of two literature reviews and subsequent interviews. The first literature review mapped and evaluated any previous research on the cyber security risks of AI, including known vulnerabilities. The second literature review examined government and industry reports to help frame the study.The assessment found that there were vulnerabilities throughout the AI lifecycle, across design, development, deployment and maintenance. The assessment also highlighted that there are significant commonalities in the defensive threats that are faced across all AI technologies.The assessment also examined how each of the vulnerabilities could be exploited and outlined the potential impacts that could result from this. These impacts included risking sensitive user data and breaches of an organisation’s network.The assessment mapped the various cyber attacks that had been conducted against AI technologies based on proof-of-concept publications and real-life case studies. It identified a total of 22 examples. Although only a few incidents were real-life examples, the assessment clearly highlighted the substantial effect that vulnerabilities can have on the safety of end-users.Organisational awareness of cyber security for AI systemsThe IFF Research survey was made up of 350 businesses who were either considering or had already adopted an AI technology within their infrastructure[footnote 42]. The survey included various cyber security questions, including whether the businesses had specific cyber security practices or processes in place for AI. Notably, nearly half of respondents (47%) had no specific cyber security practices in place specifically for AI and 13% were unsure. Of those without, or not intending to have, specific AI cyber security practices or processes, there were a few key reasons as to why they had not adopted specific practices. 14% had not considered it or did not know enough about it, and 14% said they do not use AI for anything sensitive. These findings highlight that a significant number of organisations lack cyber security practices for AI.The survey also asked participants whether there were specific cyber security requirements or features that they expect to be built into AI companies’ models and systems. Two fifths (39%) of respondents stated no and a third (33%) were unsure. This further highlights that businesses in the UK lack cyber security knowledge of AI practices and processes.Security requirements for AI models and systems are neededMindgard’s literature review sought to identify any recommendations that would help address the cyber security risks to AI. The report identified 67 sources that described 45 unique recommendations. These recommendations were divided into two categories, technical and general. It was evident that security requirements are seen as essential for this policy area, based on the overlapping requirements highlighted by
industry and governments. Notably, the author stated “there is evidence that many of the reported cyber security risks within AI strongly justify the need to identify, create, and adopt new recommendations to address them.” The assessment of cyber security risks to AI also highlighted this finding, as the report linked vulnerabilities, and their exploitation routes, to poor design and development practices.Based on the findings set out in this Annex, the evidence has suggested there is rationale for the Government to intervene to improve the security of AI.Annex B: Global approach to AIThe Prime Minister set out the government’s approach to managing frontier AI risk in October 2023. He stated: “My vision, and our ultimate goal, should be to work towards a more international approach to safety, where we collaborate with partners to ensure AI systems are safe before they are released”. International collaboration is a core element of this work to ensure that the cyber security requirements for AI are internationally aligned where appropriate. This annex details some key multilateral initiatives and international developments informing our thinking during this programme of work. We will continue to engage with a broad range of countries via bilateral dialogues as well as multilateral fora and initiatives.This international and collaborative approach underpins the UK’s effort as an established leader on AI, as demonstrated by hosting the first ever AI Safety Summit in 2023. Following the White House Voluntary AI commitments and building on the AI Safety Summit, the NCSC published their Guidelines for Secure AI System Development.[footnote 43] Endorsed by 18 countries, these Guidelines were developed by NCSC and CISA alongside industry experts and 23 international agencies and ministries, with representation from across the world. We will continue to promote international conversations on AI cyber security in the lead up to future AI Safety Summits. We will also continue to engage with a broad range of countries via bilateral dialogues and multilateral fora and initiatives to further inform our own thinking.MultilateralThe UK is taking a proactive role within multilateral discussions that link to AI cyber security and promote safe and responsible AI development, deployment and use across the world to protect citizens and our democratic values. These multilateral initiatives include:G7: Under Japan’s Presidency, the G7 launched the “Hiroshima AI Process” to address the risks, challenges and opportunities posed by AI. The UK was an active participant in the Hiroshima Process and will look to build on this positive progress under Italy’s Presidency.G20: In September 2023, as part of India’s G20 Presidency, the UK Prime Minister agreed to and endorsed the New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration, reaffirming the UK’s commitment to the 2019 G20 AI Principles and emphasised the importance of a governance approach that balances the benefits and risks of AI and promotes responsible AI for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The UK will work closely with Brazil on their AI ambitions as part of their 2024 G20 Presidency, which will centre on AI for inclusivesustainable development.[footnote 44]Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI): The UK continues to actively shape GPAI’s multi- stakeholder project-based activities to guide the responsible development and use of AI grounded in human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation, and economic growth. The UK was pleased to attend the December 2023 GPAI Summit in New Delhi, represented by the Minister for AI, Viscount Camrose, and to both endorse the GPAI New Delhi Ministerial Declaration and host a side-event on ohttps://beisgov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/CyberResilienceTeam-OS/Shared%20Documents/Communications%20%26%20core%20script/Cyber%20security%20forward%20look%20of%20   d=w20fc10c3dddd4ed4a0eccaa797eb8ee3&csf=1&web=1&e=0ribeLutcomes and next steps following the AISafety Summit. The UK has also begun a two-year mandate as a Steering Committee member and will work with India’s Chairmanship to ensure GPAI is reaching its full potential.Council of Europe: The UK is continuing to work closely with like-minded nations on a Council of Europe Convention on AI to protect and promote human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The Convention offersan opportunity to ensure these important values are codified internationally as one part of a wider approach to effective international governance.[footnote 45]OECD: The UK is an active member of the Working Party on AI Governance (AIGO) and recognises its role in supporting the implementation of the OECD AI Principles and enabling the exchange of experience and best practice across member countries. In 2024, the UK will support the revision of the OECD AI Principles and continue to provide case studies from the UK’s Portfolio of AI Assurance Techniques to the OECD’s Catalogue of Tools and Metrics of Tools for Trustworthy AI.UN and its associated agencies: Given the organisation’s unique role in convening a wide range of nations, the UK recognises the value of the UN-led discussions on AI and engages regularly to shape global norms on AI. In July 2023, the UK initiated and chaired the first UN Security Council briefing session on AI, and the Deputy Prime Minister chaired a session on frontier AI risks at UN High Level Week in September 2023. The
UK continues to collaborate with a range of partners across UN AI initiatives, including negotiations for the Global Digital Compact, which aims to facilitate the Sustainable Development Goals through technologies such as AI, monitoring the implementation of the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI, and engaging constructively at the International Telecommunication Union, which hosted the ‘AI for Good’ Summit in July 2023. The UK will also continue to work closely with the UN AI Advisory Body and is closely reviewing its interim report: Governing AI for Humanity.Technical StandardsTechnical standards are an important tool in supporting global governance of technology, international trade, and technology innovation and can be a tool alongside or in place of regulation. The AI regulation white paper identified a key role for technical standards and assurance techniques to support the implementation of the proposed AI regulatory framework, while enhancing global interoperability. Work on technical standards relating to AI is underway within multiple global standards development organisations, and the UK government is an active participant in these discussions. Cyber security standards, supported by industry and international partners, have an important role to play in driving change and protecting users. The UK actively works to uphold integrity in and reinforce the multi-stakeholder, industry-led global digital standards ecosystem which is open, transparent, and consensus-based. The UK aims to support innovation and strengthen a multi-stakeholder, industry-led model for the development of AI technical standards, including through initiatives such as the UK’s AI Standards Hub.[footnote 46]Working groups exploring aspects of AI are active in multiple standards development organisations, including the British Standards Institute (BSI), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the International Organization for Standardisation (ISO), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC), the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association (IEEE SA), the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). We are actively monitoring a number of these working groups and considering how we can effectively support efforts on technical standards relating to AI cyber security. At ETSI, we have led the creation of documents on secure AI principles, including the ETSI GR SAI 002 on Data Supply Chain Security.We welcome any contributions that AI developers and companies can make towards identifying, and coming to a consensus, on best practice. Several high-profile organisations and AI developers have produced documentation which we have used to inform the Code of Practice. We want to continue to work with UK industry leaders to ensure that we stay at the forefront of AI security.We welcome international engagement and dialogue on this topic and will collaborate, support and share information with the international community as we all look to ensure we extract the best from AI and realise its full potential.Annex C: Glossary of termsAI or AI system or AI technologies: products and services that are ‘adaptable’ and ‘autonomous’.AI ecosystem: the complex network of actors and processes that enable the use and supply of AI throughout the AI life cycle (including supply chains, markets, and governance mechanisms).AI life cycle: all events and processes that relate to an AI system’s lifespan, from inception to decommissioning, including its design, research, training, development, deployment, integration, operation, maintenance, sale, use and governance.AI risks: The potential negative or harmful outcomes arising from the development or deployment of AI systems.Application Programming Interface (API): A set of rules and protocols that enables integration and communication between AI systems and other software applications.Capabilities: The range of tasks or functions that an AI system can perform and the proficiency with which it can perform them.Evaluations: systematic assessments of an AI system’s performance, capabilities, or safety features. These could include benchmarking.Foundation model: a type of AI model that is trained on a vast quantity of data and is adaptable for use on a wide range of tasks. Foundation models can be used as a base for building more specific AI models.Frontier AI: For the AI Safety Summit, we defined frontier AI as models that can perform a wide variety of tasks and match or exceed the capabilities present in today’s most advanced models.
Input [to an AI system]: The data or prompt fed into an AI system, often some text or an image, which the AI system processes before producing an output.Large Language Models (LLMs): Machine learning models trained on large datasets that can recognise, understand, and generate text and other content.Prompt: an input to an AI system, often a text-based question or query, that the system processes before it produces a response.Segregated environments: Segregation is a process that separates critical environments and other less sensitive environments.Weights: parameters in a model are akin to adjustable dials in the algorithm, tweaked during training to help the model make accurate predictions or decisions based on input data, ensuring it learns from patterns and information it has seen before.Annex D: Call for views survey questionnaireDemographicsQ1.

Criteria that informed the development of the policy interventionsThe Government has created criteria to assess the effectiveness of each policy option. Each intervention was tested to determine if it would address the issues raised from the evidence findings (see Annex A) and promote the behaviours we want developers of AI models (see above) and those seeking to deploy AI to follow. We have included questions in the Call for Views questionnaire to gather further information to enhance our knowledge on the potential efficacy and impacts of each proposed intervention.Benefit vs Cost (to businesses, consumers and government) / potential value for moneyWe evaluated each intervention within the context of its impact on addressing the cyber risks to AI. We used the business survey results on costs and resources to inform our understanding, which will be supplemented by responses to questions in the Call for Views. We also considered each policy intervention based on if it would still be effective if there were significant changes to the Government’s plans or funding arrangements.Likely effectiveness and measurabilityEffectiveness was viewed in terms of whether each intervention would ultimately reduce the threat to users, improve AI security and how it will drive improved security for an organisation that utilises AI. Equally, it also consisted of evaluating whether the proposal could be measured to assess its impact.Barriers to ImplementationWe assessed each intervention in terms of its likelihood of adoption and support from key stakeholders and its ease of implementation. As part of this, we considered the timescale of implementation and whether there were factors faced by different stakeholder groups that needed to be considered.Unintended consequencesWe considered whether our proposed interventions would introduce the right incentives we wish AI developers and organisations to adopt, without introducing negative consequences as a side effect.Consistency with international approachesGiven the global reach of technology, we have focussed on aligning each intervention with international efforts. This aspect involved evaluating how an action could either foster international cooperation or potentially contradict or interfere with strategies adopted globally.Equity and Impact (on consumers and businesses in the market)We evaluated the impact of each intervention in terms of whether it disproportionately affected specific groups. This included examination of whether the intervention lessened competition and contributed to creating monopoly positions within the market. This should be viewed within the context of the government’s support for digital innovation (see below).Pro-innovation approachWe examined whether each policy option reduced the incentives for research and development within AI. We also examined whether the policy would prohibit or restrict products or services offered by AI companies and thus create further barriers of entry into the market. We are taking this pro-innovation approach as AI is already bringing extensive benefits to society, and we want to ensure future opportunities are not impeded by this work.Interventions that were considered by GovernmentA number of options have been considered in support of the programme’s objectives. The options set out below were considered against the criteria that informed the development of policy interventions.Measure	Rationale
Business Guidance
The responsibility for securing AI does not fall solely on one stakeholder in the AI Supply Chain. Therefore, we would welcome feedback on whether additional guidance is needed to supplement the proposed voluntary of Code of Practice; for example, this could be guidance targeted at a particular stakeholders or a particular phase of the AI lifecycle. This should be considered within the context of the significant guidance that has already been developed to date by NCSC to support organisations.

Consulting on regulation of proposed security requirements
As set out in the AI white paper response, the Government has committed resources to supporting regulators and, noted that in the future, there will be a need for a highly targeted set of binding measures that apply to the most powerful AI systems. However, it is critical that the Government understands the evidence more fully before we advance regulation. Additionally, based on previous work, it is essential that the UK works continues to work with international partners to build international consensus for baseline security requirements in this area. We will keep regulation under consideration but believe our work to finalise the voluntary Code of Practice and support efforts in global standards bodies should be the priority.

Creating a certification scheme based on the security requirements
It is important that any certification scheme is led by industry considering the various companies both in the UK and globally who provide an important service to help businesses assure products and services against specific requirements. Moreover, it is essential that international support is developed for baseline security requirements first so that any future certification scheme is based on principles that have consensus. We are therefore engaging with various countries as well as in standards development organisations and multilateral fora to promote
for AI companies
this work and the Code’s requirements.

Create a guide for AI developers to complete and provide for customers
The Government considered whether it would be useful for organisations to be provided with specific information on what steps an AI company had taken to secure their product. Based on engagements with stakeholders, the Government didn’t progress forward with this guide because of the burden it would put on organisations, and it could have brought about potential liability concerns. Additionally, we found that it would not necessarily drive the adoption of better security practices in comparison to a Code of Practice. The Government remains committed to increasing transparency in this field and welcome thoughts from stakeholders on how this could be addressed in the future.

Guidance for AI developers
In November 2023, NCSC published their Secure AI Guidelines for AI developers which provided useful information to help inform the development of models and systems. Based on our evidence and stakeholder engagement, the Code will be the most suitable document to lead on from this because it sets out the specific actions that stakeholders across the AI supply chain need to implement to help protect users. We considered whether guidance targeted at a particular phase of the lifecycle may be useful, but based on the findings of DSIT’s risk assessment, it was clear that there were risks in each phase that needed to be addressed. The Government welcomes feedback from AI developers if they believe further information on a particular area would be useful.

Guidance for consumers
While we advocate every user to take action to ensure their own digital safety and security, the Government is not progressing with this intervention because the burden for taking action to ensure a user is safe should not fall on a consumer in the first instance in the supply chain. The Code as well as the need for models and systems to be secure by design is essential if we want to ensure that consumers, businesses and the wider economy can continue to benefit from AI.

Awareness campaign targeted at organisations and users to increase understanding of security in context of AI
We recognise that there are many businesses in the UK who have not implemented AI within their infrastructure, and this may be because of a lack of understanding of what security requirements they should expect from AI developers as well as if they should have specific cyber security practices for AI models. However, our engagement and previous work has shown that the Code is a more effective lever to drive change because if we can ensure that the market is adopting the requirements then the burden on taking action will be significantly reduced on users. However, we would recommend that businesses take stock of DSIT’s Cyber Governance Code, NCSC’s Business Toolkit as well as NCSC’s specific AI guidance for businesses to help inform their commercial decisions.

Industry Security NoticeNumber 2024/08 (Issued 16/08/2024)Subject: Changes to the MOD Form 680 process to incorporate US ITAR.Introduction1. The United Kingdom is adapting its existing Ministry of Defence Form 680 (now to be referred to as F680) security process to become the administrative vehicle through which it will review and enable the release of United States International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) controlled defence articles, including technical data, to foreign persons within or outside of the UK.2. The F680 is primarily a security procedure, that enables the UK Government to control when, how, and if Defence Related Classified Material is released by UK defence contractors, suppliers or companies to foreign entities, generally for the purposes of export promotion or sales of equipment or services.3. As part of the UK-US export control reforms, the UK has secured a commitment from the US for an exemption from the ITAR to enable easier defence trade between the UK, US, and Australia, bringing significant benefits to UK industry and reducing barriers to collaboration.Amendments4. To achieve these reforms it was necessary to amend the F680 process to incorporate the requirement for a UK contractor, supplier or company to apply for and receive an F680 approval to release ITAR material to any foreign entity, including where these transfers occur within the UK borders.5. Therefore, in addition to those already required to obtain F680 approval, namely:a. Those FSC cleared companies and,a. 
b. Those obligated to comply with the UK OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL- SENSITIVE Security Conditions;this requirement adds:c. Those Contractors who become part of the AUKUS Authorised User Community and,d. Those UK companies dealing with US ITAR controlled material.6. The F680 application form on SPIRE has been updated with mandatory questions requesting confirmation that the application includes the release of defence articles including technical data subject to controls under the ITAR. If yes, applicants will then need to provide the relevant references for the licence, agreement, or authorisation under which the ITAR material was received from the US. Applicants will also be required to detail how long the ITAR material will be in their possession, which will help inform therequirement for an F680 assurance inspection which the UK MOD has also introduced to enable the exemption from ITAR.7. This F680 change in coverage is not expected to affect any existing approvals, exemptions of conditions established with the US Government inrelation to ITAR. It also is not expected to affect any releases under any other US Government controls (e.g. FMS, EAR, PSA, etc.).8. The current F680 online system (administered through the SPIRE Export Licensing system) cannot process applications where there is no foreign recipient. Accordingly, there is no requirement for F680 approval for releases of ITAR material to other UK recipients.9. It is also envisaged that there will not normally be a requirement for F680 approval for releases of ITAR material, to US recipients, however, we understand there are some instances where US Government approval is required prior to the release of ITAR material from the UK to the US. Accordingly, in these instances, a F680 could be expected to also be applicable.Action by Industry10. These	changes	will		take	effect	from		16th		August	2024,	with		an implementation	period	lasting		until		the	1st	September	2024.	This1. 
implementation period allows industry to apply for and receive F680 approval for foreign releases of ITAR material that are required during or immediately after this period.11. These changes will affect new F680 applications only. Existing F680 approvals will not need to be amended/re-submitted.12. Industry will be expected to raise new F680 applications for foreign releases of their ITAR material, in addition to any approvals received from the US.Validity/Expiry DateThis ISN is valid with immediate effect and remains so until further notice.MOD Point of Contact DetailsThe Export Control Joint Unit MOD Team (ECJU MOD) are the implementing authority for the F680 process.

 Chapter 1 IntroductionRevision to Emergency PreparednessCivil Contingencies Act Enhancement ProgrammeMarch 2012
Chapter 1 (Introduction) of Emergency Preparedness, Revised Version
12.1. Part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (“the Act”) establishes a consistent level of civil protection activity across the UK. Consistency is sought too in the way the function is carried out between the local Category 1 and 2 responders as partners covered by the Act, and in different parts of the country.12.2. The Act provides a basic framework defining what tasks should be performed and how co-operation should be conducted.12.3. Local responders work to a common framework, and make their own decisions in the light of local circumstances and priorities about what planning arrangements are appropriate in their areas.Purpose12.4. The purpose of Emergency Preparedness is to accompany Part 1 of the Act, and its supporting Regulations (The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (Contingency Planning) Regulations 2012) (the Regulations). Integrated emergency management (IEM) comprises six related activities: anticipation, assessment, prevention, preparation, response and recovery. A volume of non-statutory guidance Emergency Response and Recovery http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/emergency-response-and-recovery, describes the multi-agency framework for responding to, and recovering from, civil emergencies in the UK. This non-statutory guidance is targeted at all personnel who may become involved in emergencies. It aims to develop a shared understanding of multi-agency response and recovery arrangements across responding agencies.12.5. Emergency Preparedness supports those individuals and organisations which have a role to play in the civil protection framework and, in particular, those organisations subject to duties under the Act.1.1. 
12.6. This guidance sets out how the civil protection duties should be carried out in England and Wales. Other available guidance is referenced within the Further Reading Chapter that accompanies the Emergency Preparedness guidance.12.7. This guidance also sets out how the civil protection duties should be carried out by certain bodies in Scotland, namely the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Health and Safety Executive and the British Transport Police. These bodies exercise functions which are largely reserved on a UK-wide basis and it is appropriate for them to be subject to guidance made by a Minister of the Crown. ‘Minister of the Crown’ or ‘Minister’ refers to the most appropriate minister in the given situation. The Scottish Ministers make separate regulations and guidance which apply to other Scottish Category 1 and 2 responders which fall within devolved competence. For more information, see Chapter 10: Scotland.12.8. This guidance also applies to certain bodies in Northern Ireland, namely the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and telecommunications operators. The guidance applies to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) only in relation to emergencies arising from war or terrorism threatening serious damage to the United Kingdom. The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland may make appropriate guidance for the PSNI in respect of other emergencies to which the Act applies. Neither this guidance nor the Act applies to other bodies in Northern Ireland. Arrangements similar to those established under the Act, the Regulations, and this guidance have been set up in Northern Ireland on a non-statutory basis. For further information, please refer to Chapter 12: Northern Ireland.1.1. 
12.9. The guidance in this volume is divided into chapters. Each chapter deals with a specific aspect of preparedness within the civil protection framework. The main chapters (Chapters 2-8) describe the chief obligations imposed by the Act on Category 1 responders. Others (for example, Chapters 10-12, and 16) provide guidance which sets the work undertaken at the local level in the context of broader arrangements, including variations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is hoped that Category 1 and 2 responders will find these chapters helpful in understanding and delivering the wider civil protection framework.112.10. Each chapter in this volume has a broadly similar format:o summary;o guidance on what the Act and the Regulations require of Category 1 and 2 responders;o guidance on how to carry out the requirements of the legislation; ando other information which may be helpful (much of which is contained in lined text boxes).Supporting the chapters are: annexes, a glossary and a bibliography (collected at the end of this volume).12.11. This guidance includes a number of boxes setting out additional information. The type of box used indicates the type of information contained within it:o lined text boxes - these unshaded boxes contain advice and information that may be useful to local responders, but are not directly supported by the Act.o figures - these diagrams illustrate aspects of the good practice guidance.1 Throughout the footnotes of this document the Regulations are referred to as regulation(s) with the appropriate number. Reference to the sections of the Civil Contingencies Act are referred to as e.g. s.2(1)(c).
 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE 12.12. While the civil protection duties are detailed on the face of the Act, the detail of what those duties mean, and how they should be performed, is delivered through the Regulations.2The Act and Regulations are supported too by this guidance document, which includes guidance to which the organisations covered by the Act must have regard. 312.13. However, all the duties specified in Part 1 of the Act are contingent on the definition of “emergency”.The definition of “Emergency”12.14. “Emergency” is defined in Part 1 of the Act as: an event or situation which threatens serious damage to human welfare in a place in the UK, the environment of a place in the UK, or war or terrorism which threatens serious damage to the security of the UK. 412.15. The definition of “emergency” is concerned with consequences, rather than with cause or source. Therefore, an emergency inside or outside the UK is covered by the definition, provided it has consequences inside the UK. 512.16. An emergency is considered to have consequences inside the UK if the serious damage is within the territorial sea of the UK.6 The territorial sea is the area of sea up to 12 nautical miles to seaward of the UK coast (or, more accurately, to seaward of the coastal baseline established by statute).2 s. 2(3). See also s. 4 and s. 63 s. 3(3), s. 4(8) and 6(6)4 s. 15 s. 1(5)6 s. 18(2)PAGE 6

12.17. 12.18. 
A place in the UK may be anything from a small village to a town square to a large city. It may also include a part of a region or an entire region.Determination of when an emergency has occurred, or is likely to occur, is addressed in three ways. The Act provides:o a specification of the kinds of event or situation which may cause “damage”; 7 ando two tests for determining whether an event or situation threatening8such damage constitutes an emergency (one of which must be met).o The Regulations outline: The common procedures thatCategory 1 responders must follow in making the decision to activate a business continuity or emergency plan. 9
Damage12.19. The Act sets out a list of events or situations which may be considered to pose a threat of damage to human welfare, the environment or security.10Two tests as to whether a response is required12.20. A Category 1 responder must perform its duties under the Act only in relation to two situations, either of which poses a considerable test for that organisation’s ability to perform its functions.117 s. 1(1)-(3)8 s. 2(2)(a)-(b)9 regulation 2410 s. 1(2)-(3)11 s. 2(2)PAGE 7
12.21. The two tests are:o where the emergency would be likely to seriously obstruct its ability to perform its functions;12o where the Category 1 responder:o would consider it necessary or desirable to act to prevent, reduce, control, or mitigate the emergency’s effects, or otherwise take action; ando would be unable to act without changing the deployment of its resources or acquiring additional resources.13One of these two tests must be met for the main duties of the Act to apply.Procedure for determining when an emergency has occurred12.22. A procedure for determining when an emergency has occurred must be written into business continuity and emergency plans. The procedure should enable the person who will make the judgment to be identified, and state how they will be advised and1.1. 
whom they must inform.14
The person will usually be a post-holder identified by their
role or job title. More information on this can be found in Chapter 5 – Emergency Planning. It is particularly important that this is clearly stated in multi-agency plans.The importance of Category 1 responder functions12.23. The Act requires Category 1 responders to take up their civil protection duties by reference to their functions. Functions are defined as “any power or duty whether1.1. 
conferred by virtue of an enactment or otherwise”.15 powers and duties, as well as common law powers.
The reference covers statutory
12 s. 2(2)(a)13 s. 2(2)(b)14 regulation 2415 s. 18(1)
PAGE 8
12.24. The functions of Category 1 responders are called into play when an emergency occurs or is likely to occur.12.25. Category 1 and Category 2 responders are referred to in the Act.16 The term “responder” is not defined. However, a main purpose of the legislation is to ensure that Category 1 responders are able to perform their functions so far as necessary or desirable to respond to an emergency.17The role of Category 1 and Category 2 responders12.26. Category 1 responders are listed in Schedule 1 to the Act.18 They are the main organisations involved in most emergencies at the local level: for example, the emergency services.12.27. Category 2 responders are also listed in Schedule 11.9 They are likely to be heavily involved in some emergencies: for example, utilities and transport companies.12.28. The Act brings both groups within its framework to ensure greater consistency and co-operation at the local level.The links between the duties12.29. The main civil protection duties fall on the Category 1 responders as follows: 20
16 s. 3(4)-(5)17 s. 2(1)(d)o 
risk assessment;o business continuity management (BCM);o emergency planning; ando maintaining public awareness and arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public.o 
18 Schedule 1, Part 1 (as amended). Part 2 of Schedule 1 sets out a list of Category 1 responders in Scotland who are subject to regulations and guidance made by Scottish Ministers.19 Schedule 1, Part 3 (as amended). Part 4 of Schedule 1 sets out a list of Category 2 responders in Scotland who are subject to regulations and guidance made by Scottish Ministers.
20 s. 2(1)
PAGE 9
12.30. A fifth duty applies to local authorities alone: 21o provision of advice and assistance to the commercial sector and voluntary organisations.12.31. Two further duties are prescribed in the Regulations: 22o co-operation;o and information sharing.
12.32. 12.33. 
Risk assessment, supported by a collective process, provides the fundamental grounding for delivering the substantive elements of the Act.Emergency planning is supported by BCM, and is underpinned by the risk assessment. Its purpose is to ensure that Category 1 responders can perform their functions effectively in an emergency. It supports public awareness work and also shapes arrangements for warning and informing the public. Category 1 and 2 responders must co-operate and share information in fulfilling these duties.
21 s. 422 s. 2(5)(h)-(i), Parts 2 and 8 of the Regulations.
Figure 1.1: How the seven civil protection duties under the Act and the Regulations fit together12.34. Provision of advice and assistance to the local business community and voluntary organisations by the local authority is likely to be linked to emergency plans and to draw on risk assessments. (See Chapter 6 paragraphs 6.14 - 6.16 for further information). It will also be supported by co-operation and information sharing with partners. THE ROLE OF THE MINISTER	12.35. In the event that any areas of civil protection arrangements do not address particular hazards or threats to the satisfaction of the Government, the Act permits the appropriate Minister of the Crown to issue new regulations or to1.1. 
make an order or issue a direction.23 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 and 13.
These powers are discussed in Chapters

23 See CCA S 14(1) for Scotland, S 16(1)-(2) for Wales and S 29 for all Devolved Areas
PAGE 11
12.36. Chapter 13: Support and challenge describes the systems in place which will help the Government to identify whether there are areas where government action needs to be taken. The role of the Minister of the Crown in relation to performance development is also explained within this chapter. 24What the Act permits12.37. A Minister of the Crown has certain functions available to him/her by virtue of the Act, which may be exercised, subject in certain cases, to Parliament’s approval.12.38. These are not likely to be used frequently, but may include:ï require a responder to perform a function and, derived from that, the power to direct in an urgent situation;ï amending the list of Category 1 and Category 2 responders; andï monitor performance.12.39. Ministers have a range of powers under Part 1 of the Act. Most of these powers relate to the issuing of guidance and Regulations to support the delivery of the main duties under the Act, and are dealt with elsewhere in this guidance.12.40. This section does not deal with the emergency powers framework under Part 2 of the Act. The extent and exercise of emergency powers is addressed in Emergency Response and Recovery.12.41. A Minister may amend the Regulations or guidance issued under Part 1 of the Act. The powers to amend the Regulations are broad; the Minister may make any provision about the extent of the duties under sections 2 and 4 and the24 See CCA S 14(1) for Scotland, S 16(1)-(2) for Wales and S 29 for all Devolved Areas
manner in which they are to be performed. Section 2(5) of the act lists a range of provisions which can be included in regulations, – but this is not exhaustive.12.42. A Minister may also require a person or body to perform a function in relation to an emergency.25 For example, the Minister could require responders to purchase a particular range of interoperable equipment (subject to appropriate funding being in place).12.43. Finally, a Minister may legislate so as to amend the list of Category 1 and/or 2 responders. 26 This power is only exercisable if both Houses of Parliament have approved the order. The Minister may remove a responder from the list, upgrade the status of a Category 2 responder into a Category 1 responder (and vice versa) and add new responders.Urgent powers of direction12.44. There are circumstances during emergencies, or when they appear imminent, when consistent, decisive action is necessary. The response required might fall outside existing planning frameworks; Category 1 and 2 responders might lack the information or advice to deal with it effectively; or it may not be apparent to these responders how best to deal with the situation.12.45. Section 7 of the Act is designed to enable action to be taken by a Minister of the Crown in cases of urgency where there is insufficient time to make legislation. It is an exceptional power designed to ensure that in cases of real urgency the Government can arrange for coherent, effective action to be taken at the local level.25 S 526 S 13
12.46. The Act enables 27 a Minister to issue a direction containing any provision that could be made by secondary legislation under sections 5 and 6 of the Act, to responders or a class of responders.12.47. An urgent direction must be in writing, though it could of course arrive by fax or e-mail. The Minister must revoke his direction as soon as is reasonably practicable (which will be, at the latest, as soon as it is possible to legislate). Even if not revoked, a direction will lapse 21 days after it has been made.Monitoring powers12.48. A Minister has a range of powers to assist him/her in monitoring and overseeing the new civil protection regime. He/she may ask any Category 1 or 2 responder to provide him/her with information about the action taken under the Act.28 The Minister may require a Category 1 or 2 responder to explain why it has not taken action under the Act. If the Minister considers that a Category 1 or 2 responder has failed to comply with its obligations under the Act, he/she may take proceedings against that responder in the High Court.2912.49. These powers are not intended to be used to establish direct monitoring by the Government as a standard procedure. They will be used in exceptional circumstances. Details of mechanisms and tools to develop responder performance and compliance with the act can be found in Chapter 13.27 s. 728 s. 929 s. 10
Other statutory regimes in the field of civil protection12.50. A particular set of risks is excluded from consideration under the legislation.30 These risks are subject to the Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) Regulations 1999, the Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996 or the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2001 and their Northern Ireland counterparts. Category 1 responders are not required to exercise their duties under the Act and Regulations in relation to emergencies which are covered by these provisions.12.51. However, Category 1 responders may use the Act regime to support or supplement these separate regimes where they consider this appropriate. For example, if Category 1 responders wish to include COMAH risks in the Community Risk Register, this is acceptable. They can also make information requests under the Regulations to support the COMAH duties, if they wish.12.52. One disadvantage of a separation between the two regimes, the one supported by the Act, the other by the Health and Safety Executive, is addressed by the inclusion of the Health and Safety Executive in Schedule 1 as a Category 2 responder. Further guidance on this can be found in Chapter 19, The CCA and the fit with other legislation, which looks at how key duties under the CCA link with those contained in other site specific legislation.How the Act and the Regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland12.53. Chapters 10, 11 and 12 detail how the Act and the Regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition, each of the chapters dealing with how the duties under the Act are to be performed contains information about how30 regulation 12
that particular duty is to be performed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Note that the Regulations and this guidance do not apply to those responders in Scotland who are within devolved competence. 31Integrated emergency management and the ActIntegrated emergencymanagementEmergency PreparednessEmergency Responseand RecoveryAnticipation√Assessment√Prevention√Preparation√Response√Recovery management√12.54. Civil protection arrangements need to be integrated both within and between Category 1 and 2 responders. They should also be conducted according to a practical doctrine beginning with anticipation and assessment of risk and concluding with effective response and recovery arrangements.12.55. The Act focuses on emergency preparedness but its requirements should be seen in the context of integrated emergency management (IEM).31 The Regulations and this guidance apply to those responders listed in Parts 1 and 3 of Schedule 1 to the Act. These responders are referred to in the Regulations as “General responders” but for ease of reference they are referred to in this guidance as “Category 1 and Category 2 responders”. Parts 2 and 4 of Schedule 1 to the Act list the responders that exercise functions which fall within the competence of the Scottish Ministers. These responders are referred to in the Regulations as “Scottish Category 1 responders” and “Scottish Category 2 responders”
12.56. The following six activities are fundamental to an integrated approach:ï anticipation;ï assessment;ï prevention;ï preparation;ï response; andï recovery management.12.57. The Act focuses on two of these - assessment and preparation - and they are covered extensively in this volume of guidance on preparing for emergencies. The other volume of guidance, Emergency Response and Recovery, covers the final two - response and recovery management.12.58. Anticipation is sometimes called horizon-scanning. Category 1 responders, with the support of Category 2 responders where appropriate, should aim to be aware of new hazards and threats which might affect their locality and be ready to revise their risk assessments and plans accordingly. They may also wish to consider a mechanism to inform the public of what to do according to any new hazards and threats.12.59. Prevention is an important component of integrated emergency management.The Act does not deal with it to any great extent because it is largely a matter for other legislation, for example fire safety and industrial safety, building regulations, flood defence, maritime safety or health protection. More information can be found in Chapter 19 (The CCA and the fit with other legislation). Prevention under the Act is limited to actions that help prevent an emergency which may be about to occur. For example, activating an emergency plan in advance of a major public event.
12.60. Response and recovery management are addressed in Emergency Response and Recovery because they are not covered directly in the Act. They are concerned with managing the consequences of an emergency, rather than preparing to deal with one.12.61. Although the Act focuses on preparedness for response to emergencies, it should be seen in the wider context of safety, risk and threat management. Also, although the discussion of preparedness under the Act concentrates on the maintenance of planning arrangements, effective management is the aim. Planning is a process of preparing a Category 1 responder, its managers and personnel for the act of managing an emergency.12.62. The wide concept of IEM within and across Category 1 responders is geared to the idea of building greater overall resilience in the face of a broad range of disruptive challenges. If the response is to be truly effective in meeting the needs of everyone affected by an emergency, then all leaders of the community, industry and commerce should be aware of the contributions of local responders and other organisations. It may also be beneficial to educate the general community about how they can support themselves in disruptive challenges.12.63. In an extended emergency, the amount of work may be overwhelming, while provision of everyday services will also need to continue. Category 1 responders should explore all options for maintaining critical services, not only during the response but also throughout the recovery and aftermath proceedings, which may be lengthy.1.1.

ï The local resilience area is based on police force boundaries (paragraph 2.40).ï One form of co-operation required by the Act is the Local Resilience Forum (LRF).The LRF is the principal form of multi-agency co-operation in a local resilience area. Even so, the statutory duties fall on the individual local responders. The LRF is not a legal entity and it does not direct its members. The role of the LRF in co-operation is examined in Table 2 (paragraphs 2.39-2.69).ï The purpose of the LRF is defined (paragraphs 2.45-2.50) and its structure suggested (paragraphs 2.51-2.59)ï Responders may satisfy their responsibilities to attend the Forum by nominating representatives (paragraphs 2.66-2.69).ï The LRF has an important place in the local resilience chain in England and Wales (paragraphs 2.92-2.96).ï Most Category 2 responders are not organised to deliver their normal business in local resilience areas. The expectations which Category 1 responders place on Category 2 responders should be reasonable. Protocols are proposed which may vary the way in which Category 2 arrangements can meet Category 1 requirements (paragraphs 2.60-2.65, 2.70-2.91).ï The likely participation in the LRF of the different classes of local responder organisation (within both Categories 1 and 2) is described (paragraphs 2.108 – 2.158).ï 
The scope of co-operation2.1. The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 prescribes, in the first instance, a consistent set of four duties across all the Category 1 responders, which include the emergency services, local authorities, health services and other organisations likely to be involved in most emergencies. Four elements of the emergency planning cycle – risk assessment, emergency planning, business continuity planning, and warning and informing – must each be delivered in the same way. This standard framework provides a sound basis for local co-operation.2.2. A fifth element – promotion of business continuity management – is required of local authorities.2.3. Drawing on this common set of procedures, the Act then adds two more duties for the Category 1 responders. They are required specifically to co-operate and share2.1. 
information in delivering the other five duties.1
There are thus seven duties in all.
2.4. These requirements to co-operate and share information are given extra importance by their imposition on a larger number of responder organisations, such as the utilities and transport providers. This second grouping, the Category2 responders, have fewer overall obligations under the CCA, partly because they are less likely to be involved in most emergencies 2 and also because the underpinning sector-specific legislation and regulations, which define what they do, include duties to deliver their service during an emergency. Under the Act, the Category 2 responders are required to co-operate and share information3with Category 1 responders.4  They are also required to co-operate and shareinformation with each other insofar as this supports Category 1 responders.1 See Fig 1.1, Emergency Preparedness; Chapter 1: Introduction, p.92 Even so, the impact of flooding in 2007 and other severe weather events on some of the Category 2 responders shows how important their role is.3 Information sharing, as a separate duty, is the subject of a separate guidance chapter (Chapter 3) in Emergency Preparedness, and of additional non-statutory guidance, Data Protection and Sharing: Guidance for Emergency Planners and Responders, 2007. Information sharing remains an important aspect ofday-to-day co-operation between local responders and, as such, is considered in this chapter too.4 For a useful example from one Category 2 sector stressing the importance of information sharing with Category 1 responders, see Effective Information Sharing with Category 2 Telecommunications Providers, CCS, May 2009 http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/250370/local_resilience_forums_telecoms.pdf
2.5. Co-operation for the Category 2 responders includes looking at how delivery of the emergency duties under their own legislation, such as risk assessment, emergency planning and exercising, can most easily match with the similar CCA duties of theCategory 1 responders.5	Category 2 responders need to be fully integrated intomulti-agency planning at all levels levels, including co-operation with each other where it helps local level preparedness by the Category 1 responders.2.6. One form of co-operation between Category 1 and 2 responders, which is required by the regulations, is the Local Resilience Forum (LRF).2.7. A third grouping of local responders includes the voluntary sector to which Category 1 responders “must have regard” when carrying out their duties under the Act (see Chapter 14). There are other organisations outside the framework of the Act which are also brought into co-operation with the duty-holders in certain circumstances, such as, for example, the military (see Chapter 15).Aspects of local-level co-operation2.8. There are three essential ways of addressing co-operation:o Within your own organisation;o Directly with other organisations; ando Through managed arrangements with other organisations, which may take a number of forms.
5 regulation 4(2), 4(3), 4(4)
PAGE 5
2.9. Co-operation starts with the ability of each responder organisation to get the different parts of its own structure to work together. The Act obliges each responder organisation to ensure that all those divisions with functions that may require to be employed in an emergency are fully prepared. Effective preparation ensures that they are ready to co-operate with each other within the internal structures of the organisation, as well as with others outside the organisation. In particular cases, internal multi-directorate groups should be established to develop plans and training. The practice of civil protection under the CCA should be systematically “embedded” within each organisation.2.10. The next level of co-operation is outward facing and involves responder organisations working directly with each other (both Category 1 responders and Category 2 responders, together with the voluntary sector and other organisations) across the five main CCA2.1. 
duties.6
Meetings, visits, phone calls, correspondence, e-mails and exercises are organised
to strengthen each Category 1 organisation’s risk assessment, plan-making, business continuity arrangements and warning and informing procedures. Much of this is one- on-one liaison work which takes place all the time on a day-to-day basis. Many local responders have set up multi-agency groups (below the level of the LRF) to help them prepare their own multi-agency plans and support local preparedness and awareness.2.11. However, if the Act required simply the direct interrelationship of the duty-holders with each other – “all with all” – it would not work efficiently and effectively. For this reason, the CCA also provides for managed arrangements between the Category 1 and Category 2 responders. It cuts back on the impact of the duties by permitting various measures to help structure the relationship between responders and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. Managed arrangements also permit the duty-holders to “speak with one voice”, when appropriate, and to co-ordinate actions across a local resilience area, or part of the area.6 regulation 4(1)-(4)
2.12. In this regard, the Act and its regulations support a third form of co-operation with partner organisations through formal multi-agency structures and facilities. These managed arrangements include agreements to work together through:o protocols between responders, which may also involve those not covered by the Act; appointing a lead responder; and setting up arrangements to jointly discharge or delegate functions;o forums and support bodies at various levels, such as: the Local Resilience Forum (LRF) and multi-LRF groups, the offices of a Lead Government Department, or other central government forums 7 ; ando nominating a representative organisation to act on your behalf in attending meetings.In addition, co-operation can also be facilitated through outward-facing, structured communications methods, such as, for example:o Websites – set up locally and nationally; ando Secure national communications media, such as the National Resilience Extranet.8
7 In Wales, the equivalent structures are the Wales Resilience Forum and the Welsh Government.8 Further details on the National Resilience Extranet (NRE) can be foundat http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/emergency-response-resilient-telecommunications

 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE	A Category 1 or 2 responder “shall comply with regulations” made by a Minister of the Crown about “the extent of a duty” and “the manner in which… it is to be performed” (s2(3) and s3(3)(a)).Category 1 responders which have functions exercisable in a particular local resilience area “must co-operate with each other” and “with general Category 2 responders” in connection with the performance of their duties (reg 4(1)).Category 2 responders which have functions exercisable in a particular local resilience area “must co-operate with each... Category 1 responder” which has functions exercisable in that area and “with each other”in connection with the performance by the Category 1 of its duties (regs 4(2), 4(3))Co-operation across the five main CCA duties2.13. In looking more closely at co-operation as required in the Act and regulations, it is useful to define more clearly the circumstances in which Category 1 responders seek support from their Category 1 and 2 partners.  Category 1responders must co-operate with each other and with Category 2s.9 Category 2responders must support Category 1s in delivering their Category 1 duties and co-operate with other Category 2s in support of the Category 1s.109 Regulation 4(1).10 Regulations 4(2), 4(3)

Table 1 lists occasions11
on which the Category 1s are likely to require
co-operation in fulfilling their duties under the Act. The table includes information sharing, which is simultaneously a separate duty and a key aspect of co-operation.12Table 1: The duties to co-operate and share information: as carried out by Category 1 and 2 responders13 across the five main CCA dutiesA.

It should be noted that the emergency plans of some Category 2 responders will not be specific
to a particular local resilience or local authority area. Procedures should be designed to match or dovetail across different planning frameworks.

Across the five duties, apart from the specific duty to co-operate through the local resilience forum, co-operation “shall take such form as may be agreed between2.1. 
the relevant responders”.14
Most of these agreements for working together are
informal and routine. Practical areas for co-operation and/or information sharing are dealt with directly between responders through day-to-day liaison. Other agreements are based on more formal structures of co-operation, such as the Local Resilience Forum or procedures supported by protocols. 152.16. As a statutory requirement, the LRF has an important role in facilitating co-operation between the partners. Annex A takes the areas of co-operation and information-sharing identified in Table 1 and helps define the role of the LRF. It identifies the key areas – from risk assessment to warning and informing – where the LRF is likely to play a part in co-operation and further areas where it may be involved in information sharing.14 regulation 4(4)15 regulations 4(4)(a), 4(4)(b), 7PAGE 12
2.17. Annex A also looks at the areas of co-operation and information-sharing from the perspective of Category 2 responders. It identifies the areas where requests for co-operation from Category 1 responders are likely to have a major impact on Category 2 responders, though most of these are intermittent only. There are also areas where information requests can have a major impact.Co-operation with the voluntary sector2.18. There are local responders not captured in the schedule to the Act who may also be brought in to local planning arrangements, depending on the circumstances. One2.1. 
group – the voluntary sector - is identified in the Act 1.6
Category 1 responders are
required to “have regard to” the activities of the voluntary sector in maintaining their emergency and business continuity plans.2.19. “Regard” must be given to those local voluntary organisations whose activities are carried on in the local resilience area and are relevant in an emergency.17 Those voluntary organisations whose role is to play a significant part in emergency response, such as search and rescue organisations, should expect Category 1s to integrate them fully into multi-agency co-operation across the five main duties. Other voluntary organisations may also expect to be involved in multi-agency co-operation where their activities are relevant to emergency planning and response. Voluntary organisations are not obliged by statute to carry out their role.  In reaching an agreement to co-operate at a local level, the capability of the voluntary organisation to fulfil its role locally is a key factor. It is reasonable, when looking at collaborative arrangements as part of a local agreement with Category 1s, for a voluntary organisation to provide a locally-determined capacity and capability assessment.16 s2(5)(k)… “bodies (other than public or local authorities) whose activities are not carried on for profit”.17 regulation 23(1)PAGE 13
Managed co-operationProtocols2.20. Responders have tended to rely on custom and practice and minuted agreements to support well-established collaborative arrangements and to provide a basis for new initiatives. However, the regulations permit Category 1 responders between themselves and Category 1 with Category 2 responders to go further in the performance of their duties by developing protocols which consolidate co-operative working on a firmer basis.182.21. A protocol is a formal agreement between Category 1 responders, or Category 1 and Category 2 responders - or between them and local responders not covered in the Schedule, such as the voluntary sector or the armed forces – detailing how they will undertake or allocate responsibilities to deliver a task. Protocols may cover matters of broad agreement or detailed procedures for working together, including how to hand over tasks, provide a service or obtain additional resources. As far as possible, they should be simple, straightforward and concise. Protocols may or may not be legally binding depending on the nature of the agreement reached between the parties. Most often partners are unlikely to seek a legally-binding protocol.2.22. Protocols between local responders may be developed by the LRF or its sub-groups, or by industry groups on behalf of local responders (such as Category 2s) in a particular class or sector. Some protocols aim to insert local detail and circumstances into how co-operation is carried out. They are likely to be particularly relevant in relation to:
18 regulation 7(1)19 regulations 7(4), 7(5)o 
information sharing agreements and co-operation generally between Category 1 and Category 2 responders, including multi-LRFbased arrangements; 19PAGE 14
o multi-agency emergency planning arrangements, including humanitarian support;o arrangements for co-operation with voluntary or third sector, armed forces and other responder organisations not listed in the Schedule to the Act; ando communications planning generally:ï for managing the response to an emergency; andï communicating with the public.2.23. Particular attention should be paid when developing protocols in one local resilience area to their development in neighbouring resilience areas and more widely. Organisations whose remit covers several resilience areas may find it difficult to engage with protocols from different areas which contain conflicting requirements. Recognition should also be given to national protocols.2.24. Protocols may be used to strengthen the structure of Local Resilience Forums (LRFs), for example, to determine governance arrangements for the working of the Forum.2.25. Protocols are permitted on a cross-boundary basis between local resilience areas, as well as on a cross-border basis between Category 1 and Category 2 responders in England and Scotland.202.26. As defined in regulations, protocols are likely to specify three aspects of the co-operation required:o its timing;o its form; ando contact details for the individuals involved.2120 Protocols may of course be set up between England and Wales, but these are not addressed in regulations because the Act covers both England and Wales.

Other matters can be included as local responders wish.An example of a standard model protocol will be made available on the National Resilience Extranet (NRE).Also available on the NRE are examples of best practice case studies. These can be found at https://www.resilience-extranet.gse.gov.uk/AtlasApps/Pages/Collaborate/ DocumentStore/DocumentStore.aspx?folderid=113699. They detail the areas where protocols have been introduced and the benefits derived from them.The lead responder principle2.27. The main duties fall equally on all those Category 1 responders “whose functions” (defined as their powers and duties) are likely to be seriously obstructed by an emergency or who would consider it necessary or desirable to take action to deal with the emergency through a special deployment of resources.22 There is a risk that Category 1 responders may duplicate each other’s work when, for example, carrying out their duty of risk assessment or providing warnings when an emergency occurs.2.28. The problem is particularly acute in relation to communicating with the public.It would not be sensible for a number of Category 1 responders each to be arranging to publish the same, similar or, indeed, conflicting messages about risks and planning arrangements to the same members of the public. It would be confusing, too, if several organisations were maintaining arrangements, simultaneously to issue uncoordinated public warnings about an emergency. Gaps in the arrangements could also arise because no one organisation had taken an overview. To address these difficulties, the regulations enable one local responder to take on the lead responsibility. 23
22 s. 2(2)23 regulations 32-34. These Regulations are described in more detail in Chapter 7 of Emergency Preparedness, Communicating with the Public.That guidance also includes, at Annex 7C, a checklist of suggested protocols for warning, informing and advising the public.
PAGE 16
2.29. There is a further risk of duplication where, for example, several Category 1 responders in the same LRF area each decide they are obliged to assess the same risk or the impact of that risk (for example, severe weather). Again, more than one Category 1 responder could believe it necessary to develop an emergency mortuary plan or a coastal pollution plan. Regulations address these potential problems by permitting all those Category 1 responders whose functions are exercised in relation to a particular duty (other than the duties to communicate with the public, see Chapter 7) to identify one of their number as lead responder. The lead responder is the Category 1 responder with lead responsibility for performing a given duty in relation to a given emergency, or an emergency of a particular kind, in that local resilience area.242.30. The other Category 1 responders who are party to the decision are referred to as non-lead Category 1 responders.252.31. Many of these issues of duplication are, of course, addressed through the activities of the Local Resilience Forum. The LRF can help the Category 1 local responders determine how the lead responder principle is applied. It ensures proper co-ordination of risk assessment and multi-agency planning and, under the separate regulations, communication with the public.2.32. Regulations outline the duties on a lead Category 1 responder.26 They must:o take the lead responsibility for that particular task in that local resilience area; 27o consult the non-lead Category 1 responders in performance of the duty;
24 regulation 925 regulation 9(4)26 regulation 1027 There are likely to be different lead responders appointed for different tasks within a particular local resilience area.
PAGE 17
o keep the non-lead Category 1 responders informed about how they are fulfilling the duty; ando co-operate with non-lead Category 1 responders and, in particular, as far as reasonably practicable, obtain approval from the non-lead Category 1 responders for the way they are performing the duty.2.33. Regulations also specify the role of the non-lead Category 1 responders.28 They must:o co-operate with the lead Category 1 responder in performance of the duty;o provide information to the lead Category 1 responder which will assist in performance of the duty; ando assist the lead responder in any exercises or training in connection with the duty.The non-lead Category 1 responders do not themselves need to perform the duty to an extent that would unnecessarily duplicate what the lead Category 1 responder is doing.29 However, if the non-lead responder is not satisfied with the way the lead responder is performing the duty, then (after exhausting other remedies) it should determine for itself how it will carry out the duty.2.34. The requirement on a Category 1 responder to co-operate with another Category 1 responder in the performance of its duty (for example, by taking part in a joint exercise) applies where the former is the lead responder and the2.1. 
latter is a non-lead responder. 30
Category 2 responders are also required to
assist the lead Category 1 responder when it is carrying out duties on behalf
28 regulation 1129 regulation 11(2)(d)30 regulation 11(2)(c)
PAGE 18
of a number of responders to the same extent that they would be required to assist the individual Category 1 Responders.2.35. A decision by the relevant local Category 1 responders not to co-operate with identifying a lead responder in relation to a particular duty leaves them potentially all equally responsible for the performance of that duty.2.36. In practice, local responders have tended to operate in accordance with the above lead responder principle on an informal or customary basis.Joint discharge and delegation of functions2.37. In some instances, Category 1 responders will wish to go beyond direct or bilateral co-operation and enter into joint arrangements with other Category 1 responders. This is permitted by the regulations and can take two forms:o exercising responsibilities jointly. In this case, two or more Category 1 responders would agree that an aspect of the duties was best performed by working together. For example, a number of local authorities may decide to form a single civil preparednessunit, and staff and fund it jointly to deliver their responsibilities under the Act; 31 ando delegating responsibility entirely. For example, a local authority might decide to delegate some or all of its responsibilities to the local fire and rescue service.3231 regulation 8(a)32 regulation 8(b)
2.38. In both these instances, all Category 1 responders covered by the decision have to agree that joint arrangements are appropriate and make associated agreements in terms of transfer and other resources. Of course, they each retain ultimate ownership of their own functions and are ultimately responsible for the performance of their duties; they must therefore be satisfied that they are being delivered correctly.Local Resilience Forum2.39. Under the regulations, Category 1 responders must form a Local Resilience Forum (LRF) as part of their obligation to co-operate with each other.33 Category2 responders whose functions are exercisable within a local resilience area co-operate with other responders by attending meetings of the LRF or being represented at it.34 (In circumstances where all the Category 1 responders in a local resilience area agree, this requirement on a Category 2 may be varied).35 Often in practice, as permitted by the Act, several responder organisations in a particular class will nominate a representative to attend on their behalf.2.40. The LRF is the principal mechanism for multi-agency co-operation and co-ordination under the Act, based on each police force area. It is a process by which the duty-holders co-operate with each other. The LRF helps the duty- holders decide how they will interpret and meet their responsibilities under the CCA. It has no separate legal personality and does not have powers to direct its members. As a forum for responder organisations, it is not a local responder itself and has no specific duties under the Act.
33 regulation 4(4)(b)34 regulation 4(7)(c)35 regulation 7(5)
PAGE 20
2.41. Organisations not specifically captured by the Schedule to the Act, such as the military and voluntary organisations,36 the Department for Communities and Local Government Resilience and Emergencies Division (DCLG RED) Team and Welsh Government will generally be invited to attend the LRF, contribute to its work and be involved in its working groups and sub-groups where relevant.2.42. The chief officer group of the LRF must make arrangements to meet at least once every six months. The aim should be to space these meetings evenly and to develop a regular cycle. Meetings can be held more frequently if LRF members agree that is necessary. The chief officer group should be supported by a general working group and sub groups. The frequency of these meetings is set by the LRF .372.43. The LRF is not an operational body because it has no functional responsibilities to deliver during an emergency and no resources. However, generally, during an emergency, a particular set of those who make up the LRF are likely to come together as a multi-agency team to deliver their functional responsibilities.2.44. Table 2 compares the role of the LRF with the role of the Category 1 and 2 duty holders. It shows how the LRF, acting through the powers of its duty- holders and on their behalf, undertakes certain key tasks – such as preparing and maintaining the Community Risk Register and preparing LRF multi-agency plans. Equally, it shows how the main responsibilities are delivered by the duty holders themselves.36 regulation 2337 regulations 4(4)(b), 4(5) - 4(7)

Purpose of the LRF
2.45. 2.46. 2.47. 
The purpose of the Local Resilience Forum is as follows:o to provide a local forum for local issues;o to help co-ordinate risk assessment through production of the Community Risk Register;o to facilitate Category 1 and 2 responders in the delivery of their CCA duties;o to help deliver government policy by co-ordinating responses to government initiatives; ando to help determine a procedure for the formation of a Strategic Co-ordinating Group (SCG) by the relevant local responders at the time of an emergency.The fundamental role and first purpose of the LRF in England and Wales is as a co-ordinating group for local responders engaged in preparedness for emergencies at the police force area level.42 It should enable any of the members to bring issues forward for discussion and agreement on combined initiatives. All responders build up over time an understanding of the challenges and pressures faced by their partners and an experience of working together.A second purpose of the LRF reflects a strategic approach to preparing for emergencies. The importance of the LRF preparing the Community Risk Register (CRR) 43 is that its members develop a consistent understanding of the hazards and threats across the LRF area. The risk register also provides a sound basis for joint working. An agreed risk assessment across all the local partners helps determine the priority issues they must be ready to deal with.
42 regulation 4(4)(b), 4(5)-(7)43 regulation 15
2.48. Another strategic purpose of the LRF is to support the duty-holders so that they perform their legal responsibilities better than they would if they wereacting on their own.44 The five main duties of the Act, plus the co-operationand information sharing duties, provide a substantial agenda which changes and evolves. Many emergency situations demand multi-agency working across all the partners, including the development of multi-agency LRF plans and the exercising of those plans. Support may also be needed with protocols for information sharing and other matters and with agreements about which of the partners will act as a lead responder. The LRF is also likely to be involved with supporting the development of performance management procedures and with encouraging good practice.2.49. A fourth purpose reflects the position of the LRF in the resilience chain (see paragraph 2.92 below), namely the importance to the government of a group which will:o take forward at the local level initiatives which need to be developed within a national framework; ando facilitate discussion between local responders as requested by government and report back.Expectations from central government for delivery within a national framework are placed on LRFs – or, strictly, on the Category 1 responders, supported by the Category 2 responders, who make up the LRF – for example, as part of the government’s national capabilities programme. These expectations require formal responses and considerable engagement under the LRF’s work programme. The relationship between central government and the Category 1 and 2 responders, as mediated by the LRFs, is discussed further below (see paragraphs 2.92-2.94).44 s. 2 (5)(h)
2.50. Finally, as stated, the LRF does not have an operational role. It facilitates preparedness at the local level. Nevertheless, when an emergency occurs, at least one of the local Category 1 responders will normally 45 declare a majorincident and call together a Strategic Co-ordinating Group (SCG) (usually, though not always, led by the police). Some, or many, of the responder organisations which have met at the LRF are likely to be part of the SCG.46 The SCG’s task is to co-ordinate the response to the emergency and it is also likely to take a role in the initial stages of the recovery (after which, if required, it is replaced by a dedicated Recovery Co-ordinating Group (RCG)). LRFs must help plan how the formation of the SCG takes place so as to ensure that it happens smoothly and without misunderstandings. It is reported widely that organisations which have worked together in the LRF are more likely to respond coherently and with confidence to an emergency. The formation of the SCG is not simply a transition from the LRF. On occasions, the LRF will continue to meet while an SCG is operating.LRF – structure2.51. The Local Resilience Forum comprises all chief officer groups, working groups,
task and finish groups and sub-groups.47
The structure of the LRF reflects its
status as a forum bringing together the duty-holders.2.52	Because of its importance, the LRF chief officer group should attract a sufficiently senior level of representation.	For example, local authority representatives should be at chief executive or deputy chief executive level, and police representatives should be chief constables or their deputies. Because the discussions are strategic, the LRF chief officer group should meet relatively infrequently, though at the minimum every six months, and the meetings should be thoroughly prepared so that the time of senior officers is used well.4845 Plans are maintained by Category 1 responders and will normally be activated by a member of that organisation, the regulations do not limit the decisions to Category 1 responders. Please refer to Emergency Preparedness, Chapter 5, paragraph 5.20 for more information.46 At the time of an emergency, those organisations whose functions are affected by the emergency come together to deliver the response and to lead the recovery.47 regulation 4(7)48 regulation 4(7)(a)
2.53. The role of the general working group is to bring issues before the chief officer group and ensure its decisions are implemented. Preparation for the LRF chief officer meetings is likely to be the responsibility of the LRF general working group. It is likely that senior civil protection professionals will attend, who can help determine the most useful agenda for the chief officer group. Chief Officers may of course nominate appropriate senior managers to attend if they wish. These working group meetings should be held regularly and they are likely to be convened more frequently to prepare the business of the LRF before chief officer group meetings and to act on its decisions afterwards and between meetings.2.54. Arrangements for the LRF – including the frequency of meetings of its groups and sub-groups – should be agreed between the Category 1 responders within a local resilience area and in consultation with the Category 2 responders which exercise functions within the LRF area. 492.55. Regardless of the way in which organisations are represented in the LRF process, all papers for discussion at the chief officer group meetings should be copied to all Category 1 and 2 responders in the LRF area and any standing members which are not Category 1 or 2 responders, such as voluntary sector and military representatives. All local responders should also be invited to submit agenda items to chief officer group meetings. These procedures will allow Category 1 and 2 responders not regularly attending the meeting to know what the issues are and to submit their contribution through their representatives if they wish. They may also request to attend the meeting, or part of the meeting, because of particular concerns they have. Where appropriate, LRFs should consider publishing papers into the public domain to inform their local communities of discussions held within meetings and upcoming agenda items.49 regulation 4(5)- 4(7), 4(10)
The general working group, sub groups and task and finish groups2.56. A typical structure for a Local Resilience Forum is shown in Figure 2:Figure 2: Structure for a Local Resilience Forum2.57. The general working group is likely to be a permanent group. In the first instance, it should be made up of officers from the organisations represented on the LRF chief officer group – though these may be augmented from other responder organisations. In some areas, the chairs of sub-groups are members of the general working group. The group takes forward business such as LRF multi-agency plans and training and exercise programmes.2.53. 
2.58. Supporting the general working group will be various sub-groups. Some of these may be permanent groups, such as the risk group which co-ordinates the production of the Community Risk Register. Task and finish Groups should also be considered with a finite life to deliver a defined outcome. One role of the sub- groups and task and finish groups is to provide an opportunity for organisations which do not attend the main LRF meetings (but which are represented there) to make their contribution. These groups also provide an opportunity for responder organisations which are not involved in the whole range of civil protection work, such as Category 2 responders and the voluntary sector, to be engaged. However, they should not be used as an opportunity to remove Category 2 responders from core LRF business. (Category 2 responders are specifically entitled to attend the main LRF meetings.50 )  Membership of all sub-groups, and their role in the light of evolving LRF priorities, should be reviewed regularly.2.59. Determination of which groups should be permanent sub-groups and which task and finish groups is a matter for LRFs themselves. Possible groups are suggested as follows:o Risk – delivering the Community Risk Register; identifying priorities for the work programme;o Capabilities – matching the government’s capabilities programme, including, for example, Telecommunications sub-groups (TSGs);o Area groups – based on administrative areas smaller than the whole LRF area;o Sector groups, including the voluntary sector – see discussion of representation at paragraphs 2.66-2.69 below;50 regulation 4(4)(b), 4(7)
o Specialist groups – these are cross-organisational groupings working on particular issues, such as chemical hazards, flooding, utilities emergencies, events, welfare support for people affected by emergencies, animal health, media relations, or training and exercising; ando Standing groups – these tend to pre-exist the CCA or to exist outside its statutory framework – such as airport committees, COMAH groups, coastal groups, event planning and sports stadium groups, town and city centre groups, local search and rescue committees, or flood defence boards. (Essentially, a “friendly”relationship should be established with them to ensure that they are familiar with the work of the LRF and reporting arrangements set up in both directions. Some may usefully be brought under the LRF umbrella as formal sub-groups. It is suggested that standing coastal groups be set up in all coastal areas.)Sub-groups and task and finish groups should only be established with the approval of the LRF chief officer group and should tie into the priorities set out in the Community Risk Register. Increasingly, LRFs are adopting governance arrangements which define the role and relationship of the various groups within the structure and ensure that the programme is carried forward in accordance with sound business management principles.

The impact of the pattern of local resilience areas on all Category 1 and 2 responders2.60. The establishment of local resilience areas and LRFs on police service boundaries 51can pose particular problems.2.61. Because the administrative arrangements of local government in England and Wales vary considerably between metropolitan, shire and unitary areas, co-operation across a police boundary local resilience area is more easily applied in some areas than others. Also, the pattern of local resilience areas across England and Wales exerts particular pressures on national-level Category 1 responders such as, the Environment Agency and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency whose organisational footprints are different. Again, some of the Category 2 responders, such as, the utilities or transport companies, are organised nationally or regionally, on different boundaries. The LRF needs to take a flexible approach in recognition of these organisational differences.2.62. Also, one consequence of the local nature of arrangements under the CCA is that the way LRFs work is frequently different from one local resilience area to another. Differing procedures can pose particular problems for local responders (Categories 1 and 2) operating across a number of LRF areas. These responders are likely to have adopted a standard approach across all the LRF areas they cover. They should be prepared to show flexibility too.51 regulation 3.

The justification for basing local resilience planning on a police boundary structure is that emergencies generally have their initial impact at the local level. Response is first organised locally – usually co-ordinated by the police. It follows that, irrespective of the partners’ particular administrative arrangements and their procedures, they must have the capability to respond effectively at the local level. In this respect, it means both Category 1 and Category 2 responders must prepare at the local level with their civil protection partners. 52Nevertheless, some concessions should be made to acknowledge the difficulties which some responders, not only Category 2 responders but also some Category 1 responders, have in fulfilling expectations at the planning stage at the local level.One useful action which LRFs should take is to publish a detailed map showing their local resilience area and the local responders operating within it. It is also useful to provide clear information, possibly in a members’ handbook, about the membership of the LRF, its structures, procedures and activities.LRF – “effective representation”There are difficulties for some responders (both Category 1 and Category 2 responders) whose administrative areas cover a number of LRF areas of getting senior staff to all LRF meetings. There are also problems for the efficient functioning of the LRF where, for example, a number of organisations in the same class or sector – for example, shire district councils in England – all wish to attend the same LRF meeting. For these reasons, the regulations permit responders in a particular class, because they are operating in the same sector, to nominate a representative from that class who will act for them at the LRF meeting. This qualification of the obligation on all Category 1 responders and Category 2 responders to attend the LRF in their local resilience area, aims to ensure that meetings can be run efficiently and organisations are not over-stretched. The main requirement is that local responders must be “effectively represented”.53
53 regulation 4(8), 4(9)
PAGE 33
2.67. Where Category 1 responders do not feel they are or can be effectively represented by another member of their class – for example, metropolitan districts and unitary authorities may consider they need to be fully engaged in the LRF – then the primary duty to attend the LRF applies. Similarly, where Category 2 responders – for example, in the telecoms or the energy sectors – consider that a single organisation from their sector cannot represent them all (because, for instance, the class covers a range of different types of business), they should identify a second, suitable representative organisation, or recognise that the primary duty falls on them to be involved directly.2.68. Concerns remain that those responder organisations not attending the LRF are not engaged in its business and can fall outside the active civil protection community at the local level. Representation in some instances has tended to be determined in an ad hoc way, without regular review and renewal. In order to achieve effective representation, a more consistent procedure will be useful.  Those Category 1 and 2 responders in each class in a local resilience area 54 who wish to utilise the representation procedure should have an annual meeting to nominate an organisation (or possibly more than one) from their class to represent them for the year, unless other sound mechanisms exist.55 Over the course of the year, the representative is expected to provide an effective two-way flow of information for those in its group or sector. The mandate of the representative organisation should also be clearly stated. One Category 2 utility attempting to represent all Category 2 utilities across several sectors is not likely to be effective representation.54 See Civil Contingencies Act 2004, Schedule 1, Part 1 and 3, for classes of local responder in England and Wales.55 In Wales, a memorandum of understanding and information handbook has been produced by the Wales Utilities Group. The document provides a framework for the companies concerned to work with Category 1 responders and other Category 2 responders to meet the requirements of the Act. It sets out how utility companies engage with responder organisations and LRFs through an engagement protocol.PAGE 34
2.69. A Category 1 or 2 responder which acts as an effective representative for others:o has the authorisation of other local members of its class to take part in the LRF on their behalf;o is aware of the proceedings of the LRF chief officer group, its general working group, sub-groups and task and finish groups and is ready to take forward to the LRF issues raised by local members inside and outside these groups; 56o is able to explain current structures, policies, priorities and events in the area of civil protection affecting its sector; ando ensures that the other local members of its class which it represents are kept fully informed of issues discussed at the LRF and are invited to submit their comments or attend particular LRF meetings as appropriate.Role of Category 2 responders in co-operation2.70. Category 2 organisations are brought under the Act because local resilience can only be achieved if their emergency and business continuity plans under their own legislation reflect an understanding of, and integrate with, the plans of Category 1 responders. Category 2 planning may be regional or even national in its scope - these plans nonetheless must still acknowledge the interface with local responders in local level response arrangements and cater to their needs. Category 2 organisations also must co-operate with each other where that will help a Category 1 responder fulfil its duties.5756 regulation 4(10)57 regulation 4(3)
2.71. Category 2 responders are expected to help Category 1 responders in all aspects of the duty 5,8 but not to the extent that the demands of the Category 1 responder effectively place a Category 1 responsibility on them “by the back door”. Accordingly, Category 1 responders are expected to manage their requests for co-operation addressed to Category 2 responders – when, for example, requesting attendance at meetings of the LRF or seeking information for business continuity plans – in ways which are realistic and fair. At the same time, the Category 1 responders should not be expected to compromise their objectives.2.72. In order to address the various problems identified for Category 2 responders of meeting the demands made on them, a combination of measures should be implemented in each local resilience area:o to set the expectations of Category 1 responders at a level which is realistic and fair;o to manage Category 1 expectations and requests in the most efficient way; ando 	to address the obligations on Category 2 responders in ways which recognise the reasonable needs of Category 1 responders under the Act.2.73. Annex A aims to identify the reasonable expectations which Category 1 responders will have of Category 2 responders. The major areas where co-operation, including information sharing,59 is likely to be sought are identified as follows:o compilation of the community risk register (meetings and information sharing);58 regulation 4(2), 4(3)59 regulation 4(4). Co-operation can take many forms. In this list, two only (meetings and information sharing) are identified because they are considered to be
the most time-consuming for Category 2 responders. For a fuller description of co-operation, see paragraph 10 above.
PAGE 36
o identifying hazards and risks as the basis for specific emergency plans and exercise scenarios (meetings);o identifying business risks as part of BC planning (information sharing);o discussions with partners when developing procedures for specific plans, for multi-agency plans, and for LRF multi-agency plans (meetings);o discussions with partners when developing and planning exercises(meetings); ando discussions with partners about co-ordinating and formulatingwarning and informing messages (meetings).2.74. Some of these areas require direct contact for the Category 1 responder with a specific Category 2 partner and are unlikely to be addressed by a representative, or by other means. Therefore, the processes of attempting to manage the burden on Category 2 responders outlined below (see “The Right Issue, At the Right Time, At the Right Level”, paragraphs 2.83 - 2.87) will not meet all cases, and Category 2 responders should expect to continue to address some direct requests from Category 1 responders.2.75. Category 2 responders should expect to deal directly with the following expectations from Category 1 responders:o to meet with them occasionally to help them deliver their statutory tasks;o to take part in relevant exercises; ando to assist with information to help them complete their statutory tasks.PAGE 37
The Category 2 role is not a passive one. Category 2 responders should be engaged actively with Category 1 responders in making the relationship work.2.76. The expectation that Category 2 responders will take part in relevant local exercises is particularly important and needs to be managed carefully. Category 2 responders are subject to requests to take part in civil protection exercise programmes organised nationally or across multi-LRF boundaries. It is reasonable, nevertheless, for Category 1 responders to expect Category 2 responder involvement in local exercises where a clear need is demonstrated.2.77. In terms of the obligation under the Act to attend the LRF chief officer group, the requirements on Category 2 representatives are moderated in two ways:o They must consider attendance at all meetings; 60o They must attend meetings where all Category 1 responders in that local resilience area have invited them.61In practice, Category 2 responders or their representatives should give careful consideration to attending those meetings where items of relevance to them are on the agenda. If all Category 1 responders in the area request their attendance at a particular meeting, then the Category 2 responder or its representative must do so. However, this power to require attendance should only be used by the Category 1 responders where the item for discussion is relevant to the Category 2 responder.60 regulation 4(9)(b)61 regulation 4(9)(a)
2.78. Whether a matter is of relevance or not will be determined by the Category 2 responder or its representative organisation in conversation with the LRF secretary. In cases of dispute – where the LRF chair can demonstrate that he or she has the agreement for this course of action of all the Category 1 responders in the local resilience area62– the LRF chair can require the Category 2 responder or its representative to attend.2.79. Category 2 responders are, of course, entitled to attend any of these meetings of the LRF, its working group, sub-groups and task and finish groups if they2.53. 
wish to do so.63
Membership of these groups is determined by the LRF chief
officer group and Category 2 responders should be encouraged to attend them when relevant issues are tabled.Category 1 and 2 responders and information sharing2.80. A particular aspect of co-operation examined in Annex A is the impact on Category2.53. 
2 responders of requests for information from Category 1 responders. 64
(Such
requests can be directed at fellow Category 1 responders too, who may also benefit from a managed approach.) Annex A identifies two areas of major impact:o information required for the Community Risk Register; 65 ando information from infrastructure operators and main suppliers about business continuity risks. 66A number of other areas are identified where the impact is intermittent or minor, but they should be recognised and addressed.
62 regulation 4(10)(b)(i)63 regulation 4(10)(b)(ii)64 regulation 4765 regulation 15,66 regulation 18, 19,
PAGE 39
2.81. Requests for information – between Category 1s and Category 1s, Category 1s and Category 2s, Category 2s and Category 2s, and Category 1s and the voluntary sector – are suitable for a managed approach because:o the demands of a number of responder organisations are similar;o the volume of demands is great and can usefully be spread out or, alternatively, concentrated, or reduced; ando the capacity of partners to meet demand is limited.It is essential that civil protection partners seeking information from Category 2 responders (and other Category 1 responders and the voluntary sector) respect the difficulties that may be caused for the organisation receiving the request and refrain from an “all with all” approach67as far as possible (see also Chapter 3 on Information Sharing). Protocols relating to information sharing have been developed in some local resilience areas to ease the difficulties. A proposal for a more comprehensive protocol governing all aspects of co-operation is made in the next section.2.82. Even so, occasions remain when direct contact between local responders, one-on-one, to seek and provide information remains appropriate, as the Act requires.Category 1s, Category 2s and the voluntary sector, LRFs and multi-LRFs: “The Right Issue, at the Right Time, at the Right Level”2.83. Attendance at LRF meetings and sub-groups can create difficulties for Category 2 responders (and some Category 1 responders and the voluntary sector), particularly those which operate regionally or nationally. Category 2 responders must be invited to all LRF meetings, but the circumstances where Category 1 responders require a Category 2 to attend a meeting:67 See paragraphs 2.9 - 2.10 above.
o should be limited to those where matters of relevance will be discussed (see paragraphs 2.77- 2.78 above); ando may be modified by putting in place arrangements at the multi-LRF level which, in defined circumstances, will satisfy the requirement to meet with Category 1 local responder partners.2.84. A principle of Category 2 engagement should be that it takes place on “the right issue, at the right time, at the right level”. The key considerations are pragmatic and need to ensure that representatives of Category 2 responders attend those meetings of the LRF chief officer group, the working group, the sub-groups and task and finish groups where they need to be present and not those where they don’t.2.85. However, a further consideration is that co-operation, including information sharing, between Category 2 responders and Category 1 responders may be mediated effectively through structures at a multi-LRF level or above. Thus procedures should be agreed (and may be cemented in protocols) which identify a role for the DCLG RED team or a group of multiple LRFs – or Welsh Resilience Forum in Wales (WRF) – to facilitate co-operation between the Category 2 responders and the Category2.53. 
1 responders. 68
Examples are already in place where the formal arrangements
between Category 2 responders and Category 1 responders have been agreed across multi-LRF areas. Protocols have been designed where the duty holders themselves are the main parties to the agreement, together with the LRF(s) and organisations representing Category 2 responders from, for example, a particular utility sector.68 regulation 7.
2.86. The effect of the two moderating principles in paragraph 2.83 above is that the LRF, representing the Category 1 and 2 responders in its area, will need to determine which areas of work with particular Category 2 responders should continue to be dealt with through its structures and which can safely be delegated and formally assigned to a multi-LRF level committee on which Category 1 representatives will sit. (This task may be assisted by reference, for example, to Table 2 above which examines the tasks of the LRF, and also Annex A).2.87. Consideration should be given to how to allocate the different types of information request across the various forms of managed co-operation proposed:o through LRFs;o through groups of LRFs (and the Welsh Resilience Forum);o through LGD websites;o through Category 1 and 2 responder websites;o through secure national communications media; ando through the use of protocols between all the parties to agree the appropriate use of all the above.Support from lead government departments2.88. Working with the organisations they sponsor, lead government departments (LGDs) can act as a clearing house for answering certain generic types of request from Category 1 responders. This can be done through a variety of means including through the use of a web site with, for example, a Frequently Asked Questions page (as, for example, the CCS website on Category 2 responders69 ).

PAGE 42
2.89. LGDs can also assist LRFs by ensuring that requests for action in a local resilience area are made to the duty-holders, rather than added to the expectations placed on the LRF.Other forms of co-operation to improve information sharing2.90. Category 2 responders themselves and their national associations can assist Category 1 responders by providing generic information on their websites tailored to the specific needs of local responders.2.91. Other means of making information available to local responders are through secure national communications media, such as the National Resilience Extranet.2.53.

The LRF has essentially two roles as illustrated in Figure 1 below: 70o To link up organisations at the local level; ando 	To serve as one tier in a chain of resilience organisations at the local, multi-LRF and national levels.Figure 1: Resilience across the tiers of government

It does not, for example, describe the particular arrangements in Wales - including the Wales Resilience Forum and the links to the Welsh Government as lead government department in some areas.
PAGE 44
2.93. Supporting the LRF and facilitating its work in the resilience chain is the Department of Communities and Local Government Resilience and Emergencies Division Team in England, and in Wales, the emergencies branch of the Welsh Government (WG). In addition, there are Lead Government Departments (LGDs) which relate to each of the Category 1 and 2 responders and represent them at a UK level as well as issuing guidance in relation to their functions. WG has devolved responsibility in a number of areas, such as environment and animal health, and acts as an LGD for those areas in Wales. Finally, there is the Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) within the Cabinet Office which relates directly to the Category 1 and 2 responders and to the LRFs and is responsible for the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and local resilience policy. It also co-ordinates the resilience work of LGDs. The CCS and LGDs report to a Cabinet sub-committee on Threats, Hazards and Resilience and Contingencies (NSC (THRC)), which itself reports to a Cabinet committee, the National Security Council (NSC).2.94. The LRF should not be expected to act in the same way as an arm of government, funded and resourced to deliver policy objectives.  It is a forum required under the CCA regulations, but it may not have paid staff and its essential role is to help the duty-holders determine what to do in accordance with local circumstances.  Government’s formal relationship is with the duty-holders, the Category 1 and 2 responders, who have the principal responsibility for delivery.2.95. The LRF is also not an entity which represents its local responder members in a legal sense. In this respect, the LRF cannot “deliver” its members. However, the duty-holders can agree to bind the LRF to a certain course of action if they wish.2.53. 
2.96. As suggested above7,1 the aim of delivering a more robust LRF which can act more decisively can be achieved through agreement on governance arrangements which can be supported by a protocol between all the Category 1 and 2 partners. It can also be assisted by agreements for joint discharge of functions between key responders.Leadership and management2.97. There are several aspects of leading the LRF and ensuring that it works well, such as chairing the forum, the role of the secretary, the development of governance arrangements and sound business management practice and the possible appointment of an LRF manager.2.98. Traditionally in many areas, the role of chair has fallen to the police. The matching of the LRF boundary to the police boundaries reflects the police’s key co-ordinating role in many types of emergency. Generally, it makes them well placed to co-ordinate the multi-agency partnership of responder organisations, many of which are likely to operate within only part of – or, alternatively, over a wider geographical area than – the local resilience area. Even so, the choice of chair remains a matter for local determination.2.99. Various factors should determine the choice. The chair should be able to:o take on the job on a long term basis;o speak with authority about the forum area;o speak with authority about strategic civil protection issues; ando commit sufficient time to prepare for forum meetings.71 See paragraph 2.24
2.100. The chair may also represent the LRF at meetings with other tiers, including devolved and central government, or nominate another member of the LRF or its sub-groups to do so, at the appropriate senior level. Usually those nominated to attend on behalf of the LRF will be familiar with, and actively engaged in, the functional subject areas under discussion and may be the chair of the relevant subgroup2.101. The secretariat support role is crucial in ensuring the LRF performs effectively. This clearly involves the appointment of an efficient secretary but it may also require a co-ordinator or manager to assist the chief officer and general working groups and ensure that the business of the forum across all its sub-groups and task and finish groups is dealt with satisfactorily. The two roles can fall to any of the member organisations and there are several instances where, for convenience, the role is performed by the chair’s organisation, or the roles are co-located. However, it should generally be a different organisation from that providing the chair, possibly a local authority, so as to get the widest knowledge at the centre of the LRF of the range of functions engaged in preparations for emergency.2.102. In relation to the LRF chief officer group, the working group, various sub-groups and task and finish groups, and other activities, the support role to the chair has a number of key tasks, as follows:o fix the date of chief-officer level LRF meetings;o agree the agenda and attendance with the LRF members;o organise the production of papers and presentations;o circulate papers to all Category 1 and 2 responders in the LRF area;o brief the chair;o take the minutes and follow up the matters arising and action points;o disseminate the minutes to all Category 1 and 2 responders in the LRF area and other LRF members;o 
o ensure that meetings of the working group, sub-groups and task and finish groups are effectively organised and recorded; ando ensure that relevant issues from these groups are brought to the attention of the chief officer group.Where a co-ordinator or manager has been appointed, the following additional tasks may be undertaken (though without a manager, these are undertaken by the LRF chief officer group and the working group):o track progress in carrying out the forum’s decisions, including competent delivery of its programme, which may include the Community Risk Register, developing multi-agency plans and running multi-agency exercises;o prepare and deliver from time to time a strategic assessment on the capability and readiness of local responders, acting together, to respond; ando act when necessary as a focal point for the dissemination of documents containing policy initiatives and requests from other levels of government.2.103. All of these tasks, but particularly the last three, illustrate the burden of work falling to LRFs, which has encouraged them to find ways of appointing managers where they can. The LRF is not a fully-staffed, corporate body, supported by a secure funding stream. As a result, the expectations placed on it can sometimes strain its limited infrastructure. The LRF relies on voluntary contributions in kind or through subscription from its members. Accordingly, central government will endeavour to reduce the demands placed directly on LRFs by circulating communications and expectations for action in the first instance to the specific Category 1 and 2 duty-holders whose contributions are required. LRF chairs and secretariats will be fully informed of all these communications and be invited to co-ordinate initiatives.2.53. 
2.104. The LRF is likely to rely on its member organisations – in addition to those providing the chair and the secretariat – taking initiative and progressing work through the general working group, the sub-groups, the task and finish groups and other projects.2.105. Various factors should determine the choice of who provides the secretariat. Those taking up the task should:o take on the job on a long term basis;o be competent to support the chair at strategic level meetings;o have the back up of an administration team within their own organisation; ando be competent to organise, or to support officers from their own or other organisations, in administering the work of the working group, sub-groups, task and finish groups and other projects.LRF funding2.106. Dedicated funding can achieve greater consistency of performance in LRFs. In most cases, providing a secretariat - or a co-ordinator or manager-relies on a subscription scheme. Subscription from LRF members has achieved good results in a number of areas and should be considered as a practical way of standing the forum on a firmer footing.2.107. Establishing LRFs on a firmer basis with greater resources to support the chair and secretariat will require full consent from the members, who will wish to ensure that sound governance arrangements and an effective work programme are in place. Some support for the work of sub-groups, as well as the main LRF, may be appropriate in some instances.2.53. 
Participation in the LRF2.108. This section looks at how participation in the LRF process is likely to be organised in practice for different classes of organisation. The descriptions below are guides rather than definitive structures, and will need to be tailored to reflect local circumstances. But they do represent what Category 1 and 2 responders have indicated as reasonable expectations at the local level.Category 1 responders2.109. Local authorities play a critical role in civil protection. They have a wide range of functions likely to be called upon in support of the emergency services during an emergency, including key statutory responsibilities such as environmental health, housing, social services and highways. As the response phase comes to an end, the impact on the community becomes a key issue. At this stage, the recovery phase, the local authority is likely to take the lead co-ordination role as part of its wider community leadership responsibility.2.110. Each local authority retains the right to attend the LRF. But it may not be practical for every local authority in any given LRF area to be a member of the full LRF. Despite their legal autonomy and individual approaches to civil protection, in many instances, it will make sense for local authorities to nominate one or more of their number to act as effective representatives on the LRF.2.111. Police forces co-ordinate the response to most emergencies on land. Their key role in co-ordinating the response is based not only on the need to protect the scene for emergency workers and vehicles and preserve evidence of a potential crime; the police are also often expected to co-ordinate information to the public about the emergency, including dealing with the media. This strong presence in co-ordinating the response has meant that the police are often called upon to co-ordinate multi-agency policy work at the strategic level as well.2.53. 
2.112. As the LRFs have been based by definition on police areas, there will be a single local police force member for each LRF. Each police force will have a single representative, though it may have a second if it has taken on the role as chair.2.113. The British Transport Police (BTP) plays a role akin to local police forces, albeit in a more specialist and limited environment. It takes responsibility for the management of incidents on the rail network and at train stations.2.114. In most LRFs, the local police force will represent the BTP. The exceptions to this are likely to be those meetings where particular consideration is given to rail transport issues, including risk assessments and plans.2.115. The Fire and Rescue Service is a key Category 1 responder. It has a pivotal role to play in the risk assessment and response to a wide range of emergencies, both fire and non-fire related. Its co-ordination role of the fire and rescue service in a multi-agency incident is normally focused on operations inside the inner cordon. Fire and Rescue Services’ expertise and equipment for dealing with chemical emergencies, including decontamination on behalf of the health service, and their search and rescue capabilities, give them a key role in multi-agency planning.2.116. In many cases, outside Wales, the boundaries of the local fire and rescue authority will be coterminous with or very similar to the LRF area. It will generally be appropriate for the fire and rescue authorities to have a single representative. Any other fire and rescue authorities which also fall within the same LRF area will be most efficiently represented by the lead authority, with that authority taking responsibility for keeping its colleagues informed of LRF deliberations.2.53. 
2.117. Although a part of the NHS, the Ambulance Service has a distinct place within the multi-agency civil protection effort. As one of the emergency services, they are at the vanguard of emergency response.2.118. If a number of ambulance trusts operate within the same LRF area, it will probably be appropriate to agree a lead trust (reflecting both the geographical coverage within the LRF area and commitments with other LRFs). In Wales, there is a single ambulance trust covering all four police areas.2.119. The National Health Service 72 (NHS) is a patient-led service across primary, secondary and tertiary care. Health sector organisations covered by the Act include Strategic Health Authorities, Primary Care Trusts, Local Health Boards, the Public Health Wales NHS Trust, Trusts (Foundation and Non-Foundation) that provide hospital accommodation and services in relation to accidents and emergencies, and also Ambulance Trusts. The above NHS organisations are all subject to duties under the Act as Category 1 responders, with the exception of Strategic Health Authorities, which are Category 2 responders (and are described below at paragraphs 2.151-2.152).2.120. Particular care needs to be taken in establishing co-operation with the various parts of the health structure at LRF level. In addressing the responsibilities of a large organisation, it is challenging for single NHS representation to portray accurately the position of the entire local health economy on the LRF. Some LRFs have a health sub-group on which all the various health organisations are represented. In England, the local NHS is normally represented at the LRF by the lead Primary Care Trust (apart from the ambulance service which is separately represented in its own right) or, in exceptional circumstances, the Strategic Health Authority. In Wales, Health Boards, the Public Health Wales NHS Trust and the Welsh Ambulance Services Trust will normally each be represented.72 References to NHS structures will be amended as appropriate following restructuring
2.121. Notwithstanding its close links with the NHS, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) should be represented separately.2.122. Port health authorities are concerned with the prospect of human, animal and crop diseases being imported into the UK at seaports and airports.2.123. Port health authorities are unlikely to be directly represented on the LRF. Generally, they will be represented by the local authority or (in some circumstances) the HPA. Like the BTP, they will be expected to attend the LRF meetings when issues relating to their functions are discussed.2.124. The Environment Agency aims to protect and improve the environment, and to promote sustainable development. It plays an important supporting role in planning for and responding to emergencies: in particular, it has key roles in relation to flood risk management and environmental regulation.2.125. The Environment Agency has seven regions and 19 operational areas across England and Wales and will be directly represented by the Environment Agency area in which the LRF area is located. Where the LRF falls across an Environment Agency area boundary, the Environment Agency has agreed to nominate a lead area and thus a single representative.2.126. The Environment Agency will be represented by the area manager or nominated deputy from the lead area and will provide advice and information on all aspects of the environment for which it has a statutory responsibility.2.53. 
2.127. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is responsible for the initiation and co-ordination of civil maritime search and rescue within the UK Search and Rescue Region, and as such is an emergency service. It carries out this function through HM Coastguard. This role is described in the Search and Rescue Framework for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.2.128. The MCA also leads the response to maritime pollution incidents in the UK Pollution Control Zone. It manages a multi-level plan, the National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations, for co-ordinating responder organisations dealing with pollution at sea or on the coast.2.129. The MCA is structured around three “regions” (Eastern; Wales and West England; and Scotland and Northern Ireland). Within each region, there are three HM Coastguard operational areas. These regional and area boundaries do not coincide with coastal police force areas.2.130. The MCA will be required to take part in the LRF process only in coastal LRF areas. It will be represented at the LRF by an HM Coastguard manager from the Coastguard “region” where the LRF is situated. In most cases, this will be the manager from the relevant area. These managers will be able to provide advice and information on all maritime emergency response matters. In addition, the MCA has a central resilience unit and each “region” has a senior MCA/ HM Coastguard officer dedicated to resilience matters.2.53. 
Category 2 responders2.131. Electricity distributors and transmitters are covered by the Act. During an emergency affecting electricity supplies, the companies retain control of their operations and have to meet their obligations as prescribed by the regulator. It is crucial that their planning arrangements be understood by the Category 1 responders, and vice versa, and that there be a free flow of information between them.2.132. Electricity companies operating within a given LRF area may be expected to attend the LRF meetings when relevant agenda items are tabled. They are likely to be represented by one or more of their number, who will report back to them.2.133. Gas distributors and transmitters are covered by the Act. During an emergency affecting gas supplies, the companies retain control of the operation and have to meet their obligations as prescribed by the regulator. It is crucial that their planning arrangements be understood by the Category 1 responders, and vice versa, and that there be a free flow of information between them.2.134. Planning in relation to oil and gas pipelines is covered by the Pipelines Safety Regulations.These arrangements, including exercises, are likely to be reported to the LRF.2.135. The main gas distribution company in an area may attend the main LRF group on the basis of ‘right to attend, right to invite’. It may act as a representative for other gas distributors, and report back to them.2.136. Water and sewerage undertakers. During an emergency affecting water or sewerage, the companies retain control of their operations and have to meet their legal obligations. It is crucial that their planning arrangements be understood by the Category 1 responders, and vice versa, and that there be a free flow of information between them.2.53. 
2.137. In many cases, there will be one water company operating within an LRF area. It will attend the main LRF group on the basis of ‘right to attend, right to invite’. Where there is more than one company, they may be represented by one of their number, which could report back to them.2.138. Telephone service providers, fixed and mobile. There are many providers of landline services. There are five mobile telephone operators, each organised on a national basis. During an emergency affecting fixed or mobile telephone supplies, the companies retain control of their operations and have to meet their obligations as prescribed by the regulator. It is crucial that their planning arrangements be understood by the Category 1 responders, and vice versa, and that there be a free flow of information between them.2.139. Fixed-line and mobile companies operating within a given LRF area may be expected to attend the LRF meetings when relevant agenda items are tabled. They are likely to be represented by one of their number, which will report back to them.2.140. Railway operators. Responsibility for operation and maintenance of the railway track rests currently principally with Network Rail. There are a number of train operating companies, organised on a national and regional basis and dealing with passengers and freight. During an emergency affecting the railways, the companies retain control of their operations and have to meet their obligations as prescribed by the regulator. Network Rail and some train operating companies are also responsible for operating mainline stations. It is crucial that these planning arrangements be understood by the Category 1 responders, and vice versa, and that there be a free flow of information between them.2.53. 
2.141. Freight train operators will in most cases be represented by Network Rail. In some instances it may be appropriate for passenger train operating companies to be represented by Network Rail also.2.142. Airport operators. Not every LRF area will have an airport within it. And not every airport will be subject to the obligations. Only “relevant airport operators” are covered by the Act. ”Relevant airport operators” are defined as those with an annual throughput of at least 50,000 passengers or 10,000 tonnes of freight.2.143. During an emergency affecting an airport, the airport retains control of its operations and has to meet its obligations as prescribed by the regulator. It is crucial that its planning arrangements be understood by the Category 1 responders, and vice versa, and that there be a free flow of information between them.2.144. Each airport is likely to represent itself directly in the LRF process, either at the main group or at a relevant sub-group.2.145. Ports. Not every LRF area will have a port within it. And not every port will be subject to the obligations. “Relevant harbour authorities” are defined as those with an annual throughput of at least 200,000 passengers or 1.5 million tonnes of freight. During an emergency affecting a port, the harbour authority retains control of its operations and has to meet its obligations as prescribed by the Secretary of State. It is crucial that its planning arrangements be understood by the Category 1 responders, and vice versa, and that there be a free flow of information between them.2.146. If more than one relevant harbour authority operates within an LRF area, they are likely to nominate a lead operator to attend either the main LRF group or a relevant subgroup. This role may be taken on by a representative of the British Ports Association.2.53. 
2.147. The Highways Agency is an executive agency of the Department for Transport (DfT), responsible for managing the English Strategic Road Network, comprising motorways and A-roads (primary routes). The Highways Agency does not operate in Wales, where WG has responsibility for trunk roads. Divided into a number of operational regions and areas, the work of the Highways Agency includes maintenance and development of roads, structures and equipment on the Network. Since 2004, with the introduction of the Traffic Officer Service, operational management of traffic on those roads has also become an important part of the Agency’s remit, with the National Traffic Control Centre providing traffic and travel information through a variety of media across the Network. The Agency also has a keen interest in multi- agency working and partnerships with all key stakeholders, in particular the Police, helping to respond effectively to incidents.2.148. It is crucial that these planning arrangements be understood by the Category 1 responders, and vice versa, and that there be a free flow of information between them. Highways Agency emergency planning teams exist within each region and will attend LRF meetings and sub-groups on the basis of “right to attend, right to invite”.2.149. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has a crucial role to play in certain aspects of the LRF process. In particular, the HSE has a significant input to make in the assessment of risk, and the development of the Community Risk Register. The HSE also has a role in relation to offshore oil and gas installations.2.150. The HSE may be expected to attend LRF meetings and sub-groups when relevant items are tabled.2.151. Strategic Health Authorities73(SHAs) in England act as the regional headquarters for the NHS. They do not deliver services but provide leadership, co-ordination and supportacross a defined geographical area, managing the performance of PCTs and NHS Trusts.73 References to NHS structures will be amended as appropriate following restructuring.
2.152. Arrangements vary, but SHAs are likely to represent the NHS at multi-LRF Forums. Co-ordination between the SHA and the lead PCTs in each LRF area ensures sound representation.Other co-operating bodies2.153. The DCLG Resilience and Emergencies Division (DCLG RED) and the Welsh Government (WG) are responsible for ensuring that there is good two-way communication between Category 1 and Category 2 responders and central government, that planning is co- ordinated where necessary, and that Category 1 responders have the support they need. DCLG and WG need a full understanding of the work of LRFs, not least because of the requirement to develop plans for emergencies beyond the local level.2.154. DCLG and WG can be expected to be standing members of the LRFs in their area. They will generally attend only as observers, though they will be able to add value in a number of ways, including offering advice on the wider picture, and encouraging cross- boundary working and the sharing of good practice.2.155. The armed forces have a small permanent role in local civil protection through the provision of unique and guaranteed military “niche” capabilities, such as explosive ordnance disposal or search and rescue. As part of the wider government response, Defence can also make a significant contribution in support of Category 1 responders at times of serious emergencies through Military Aid to the Civil Authorities (MACA). The armed forces remain prepared to respond to a range of emergencies in the UK, especially where Defence can make a strategic impact. There are no standing forces allocated to UK resilience, however, and assets are drawn from across Defence to meet specific demands. Since the Armed Forces are a centralised organisation under direct control of central government, requests for assistance are considered at national level.2.53. 
2.156. It is important that Category 1 responders establish close links with the armed forces in their area. Through the medium of LRFs (and multi-LRF groups/ Wales Resilience Forum), Category 1 responders will develop a greater understanding of how the armed forces might support a response to an emergency. It is therefore important that the Regional Brigade, via the Joint Regional Liaison Officer (JRLO), is represented at the appropriate level on LRFs since he or she is best placed to provide appropriate guidance on seeking military assistance. Clear guidance on Defence’s role is contained in MoD’s, The Defence Contribution to UK Resilience – A Guide for Civil Responders, 2009 7.42.157. The Met Office provides services that can help Category 1 and 2 responders prepare for and respond to emergencies that are caused or influenced by the weather. These can include severe weather warnings, plume predictions and storm tide alerts. Linked to these services is advice on the interpretation and impact of the weather during an emergency.2.158. The voluntary sector is organised nationally and locally and can provide a wide range of skills and services. It has a key support role to offer to the emergency services and other responding organisations in emergency planning and response and, in certain circumstances, such as rescue at sea, an operational role. At the national level, the Voluntary Sector Civil Protection Forum ensures communication and co-operation between organisations in the voluntary sector themselves. Further detail on the voluntary sector’s work is set out in Chapter 14.74 http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/84992BEC-0918-41E6-8CB4-11FD23D5B119/0/JDP022EdAddendumWeb.pdf

 Formal Information Sharing Under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004Revision to Emergency Preparedness, Chapter 3 (Information Sharing)Civil Contingencies Act Enhancement ProgrammeMarch 2012
Chapter 3 (Formal Information Sharing) of Emergency Preparedness Revised Version1 Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (Contingency Planning) Regulations referred to in this Guidance as the Contingency Planning Regulations.

 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE The duties quoted below outline formal legal requirements. However, most information sharing will be undertaken voluntarily within the context of broader co-operation between responders.A Category 1 or 2 responder “shall comply with regulations” made by a Minister of the Crown about “the extent of a duty” and “the manner in which… it is to be performed” (s2(3) and s3(3)(a))Regulations under the Act “may permit or require a person or body listed in Part 1 or 3 of Schedule 1 to provide information, either on request or in other specified circumstances, to a person or body listed in Part 1 of the Schedule in connection with the performance of a duty under subsection (1)”. This is subject to Part 8 of the Regulations.Purpose and Scope3.1. Information is shared between Category 1 and 2 responders as they work together to perform their duties under the Act. Information sharing is a crucial element of civil protection work, underpinning all forms of co-operation. It may involve simple liaison between bodies keeping each other up to date on their current arrangements and future plans. Such activities may be carried out through LRFs and multi LRF groups, and more informally.3.1. 
3.2. Information sharing may also involve direct contacts, formal or informal, between Category 1 and 2 responders seeking knowledge of hazards, risk assessments or planning arrangements (including warning procedures) and other matters, where the information is in the possession of one, and the other believes it needs the information to fulfil its civil protection duties.3.3. The process of sharing information is crucial to other duties under the Act as represented in Annex A of Chapter 2 (Co-operation) ?. These are:o sound risk assessment relies on obtaining accurate information about the nature of the hazard, the probability of a hazardous eventoccurring, and the potential effects and impact on the community if it does. Each of these elements may involve some specialist knowledge and calculation and the information required may be privileged or sensitive and not generally in the public domain.o business continuity management largely involves knowledge of the vulnerabilities of one’s own organisation – but it also examines linkages to and dependencies on suppliers and contractors, where information may be harder to obtain.o emergency planning relies essentially on knowledge of how each of the partners in response has planned to perform – what their aims and contribution will be, how they will organise and co-ordinate their efforts with those of other bodies, and how contacts will be managed before and during the event. All these details are constantly changing as plans are revised, organisations are restructured or their roles redefined, and individuals and teams are replaced.2 This refers to a table in the 2012 revision of Chapter 2 (Co-operation) of Emergency Preparedness.
3.4. Information sharing is necessary so that Category 1 and 2 responders are able to make the right judgements. If Category 1 and 2 responders have access to all the information they need, they can make the right decisions about how to plan and what to plan for. If they do not have access to all the information, their planning will be weakened. They will be less well placed to make judgements around cost-benefit analysis – what to plan for and what not to plan for.3.5. But the picture is complicated because each individual Category 1 or 2 responder needs to get its planning right and this has to be balanced against the needs of others. For example, sharing a piece of information which helps the planning of one Category 1 or 2 responder, might, in some circumstances, harm the interests of another Category 1 or 2 responder.	Also, the perspective of an individual organisation on a single piece of information can be affected by its own position, so an organisation can interpret information in a way that seems correct but is actually wrong. For example, a Category 1 or 2 responder might interpret something to be a risk, but another Category 1 or 2 responder with greater expertise might be less concerned. And in some circumstances, Category 1 or 2 responders will not be able to appreciate the bigger picture into which the information fits. For example, a seemingly innocuous piece of information might have implications for national security.3.6. These two competing factors point towards a framework in which the initial presumption is that information should be shared, but that some information should be controlled if its release would be counterproductive or damaging in some other way.3.1. 
Devolved Administrations3.7. The way in which the information sharing duty under the CCA and the Contingency Planning Regulations apply to Category 1 and 2 responders in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is much the same as in England. The key points in relation to the information sharing duty are:o in Scotland, Part 1 of the CCA and the Regulations (which includes the disclosure of information provision under which the Regulations were made) apply to Scotland, with the powers it sets out residing with Scottish Ministers; ?o in Wales, arrangements under Part 1 of the CCA and the Regulations apply; ando in Northern Ireland, arrangements under Part 1 of the CCA andthe Regulations apply only to a limited number of organisations: PSNI, MCA and telecoms providers.Where relevant, LRFs should be aware of the different structures in place and consider cross boundary information sharing requirements.When information should not be formally requested3.8. In most instances, information will pass freely between Category 1 and 2 responders, as part of a more general process of dialogue and co-operation. This is the means by which the overwhelming majority of information sharing should happen and has happened. Annex A of Chapter 2 sets out the areas in which responders will expect to share information.3 Part 8 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (Contingency Planning) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 (SI2005/ 494).
3.9. The Regulations require Category 1 and 2 responders to consider alternativeroutes before pursuing a formal information request.4  But there are still someinstances in which the supply of information will be more controlled. Under the Regulations, any Category 1 or 2 responder can request information from another Category 1 or 2 responder, so long as it is for the purpose of fulfilling responsibilities under the Act, or the performance of another function which relates to an
emergency. 5
This should be seen very much as a fallback option and every effort
should be made to maintain relationships between Category 1 and 2 responders that allow information to be shared without recourse to formal requests. But should formal requests be necessary, there are a number of procedures that need to be followed in order to make the system work. This ensures that Category 1 and 2 responders make proper efforts to use existing and informal routes to gather information. The aim of this provision is to avoid over-bureaucratisation of the information-sharing process, and reinforce the message that the information-sharing mechanisms under the Act should be regarded as a fallback rather than as the first option.3.10. Where it is necessary to resort to the formal request process, one or more Category 1 or 2 responders will request the information and one or more will receive the request. They are known respectively as “the requesting Category 1 or 2 responder” 6 and “the receiving Category 1 or 2 responder.” Where the information is required by a number of Category 1 responders, the request may be co-ordinated through the LRF or LRF members may agree on a lead responder co-ordinating such a request. In addition, any multi- Local Resilience Forum groups may facilitate the co-ordination of such requests from across more than one LRF area.4 regulation 47(3)(b)5 regulation 476 regulation 47
In Wales, this role is undertaken by the Wales Resilience Forum (WRF).	This co-ordinated approach to information sharing should reduce the burden on those agencies from whom information is requested. Before making a request, first, the Category 1 or 2 responder must be satisfied that it does not already hold the information, either by virtue of a previous request or because of informal information exchange. Category 1 and 2 responders should, as a consequence, marshal the information they hold in such a way as to ensure they can make a judgement on this point.3.11. Secondly, the Category 1 or 2 responder must satisfy itself that the information is not reasonably accessible to the public – that is to say, is not published by the Category 1 or 2 responder as part of its wider information policy.  Examples of this would include material made available in annual reports or accounts, or material on websites (both those of individual Category 1 or 2 responders and general websites with generic information).3.12. Thirdly, the Category 1 or 2 responder must satisfy itself that the information cannot be obtained by other means. This includes all forms of informal dialogue and information sharing, and obliges Category 1 and 2 responders to work together in the first instance to agree information flows that meet the need of those organisations involved. To assist the process LRFs are strongly advised to develop information sharing protocols. These should recognise any pre-existing organisational relationships and will include many of the informal information sharing agreements that exist at the local level. Category 1 and 2 responders also have or may have pre-existing requirements on them under other legislation (including, for example, their licence conditions from a regulator,3.1. 
or by direction of a minister) to assess risk and to prepare planning arrangements for emergencies. This may mean that relationships and information-sharing routes are already established. Where possible, these should be built on and complemented, rather than duplicated.Formal procedures for requesting information3.13. In any instance of information sharing, one or more Category 1 or 2 responders will request the information and one or more will receive the request. They are known respectively as “the requesting responder” and “the receiving responder”.73.14. An information request should be made in writing. It must specify either the information required or a description of the information requested. The request should be sufficiently precise that the nature of the information sought is clear. The request must include reasons as to why the responder needs the information.83.15. The request may specify a time limit, and the place at which the information should be provided. The request may also specify the form in which the information is to be supplied (eg in paper form, on disk). In each case, the time allowed and the place and form specified, must be reasonable. For example, a requesting responder seeking details from an established plan might allow a week for the receiving responder to reply. But if the information being sought is, for example, not presently collated in an easy-to-share way, or can only be released with the permission of a third party, a month might be more applicable. Wherever possible, the mechanics of the request should be discussed in advance between responders.3.16. A template for requesting information can be found at Annex 3.7 regulation 478 regulation 48
Procedure for dealing with a request3.17. A valid request for information in possession of the Category 1 and 2 responder receiving the request, must be complied with unless one of the exceptions applies (see paragraph 3.23). This is the case even where the information has been originally supplied in confidence – though the responder which receives the information is also likely to become subject to that duty of confidence. Where the responder is subject to restrictions on the disclosure of information in another enactment or a contract, the other enactment or contract will have to be considered in light of the Regulations. Which provision applies will depend on the particular terms of the other enactment or contract.3.18. In considering whether the request is valid, a responder should consider if the procedural requirements have been satisfied and whether the reasons given by the requesting responder indicate the information does appear to be reasonably required in connection with the requesting responder’s functions.3.19. The information must be provided within the time limit specified in the request.If no time limit is specified, the information must be provided in a reasonable period. The information must be supplied in the form and at the place specified by the request.3.20. The request relates to information, not documents. A responder which receives a request is not required to disclose all the documents which contain the information which has been requested. However, this will often be the easiest way to deal with an information request. In other cases, a new document which contains the information being requested may be prepared.3.1. 
3.21. A template for responding to a request for information can be found at Annex 3.3.22. Templates for making and replying to information requests can be found at Annex 3.Storing information3.23. Category 1 and 2 responders should also be aware of the differences required in handling personal data, when compared to handling sensitive security-related or commercial information (see paragraph 3.26).3.24. It is essential that Category 1 and 2 responders who request information formally or informally have appropriate methods of secure storage when the requested information is received. Each agency should have a locally defined protocol for handling, accessing, and storing information, especially that which relates to sensitive information.Exception to the duty to provide information: sensitive information3.25. Not all information can be shared, and Category 1 and 2 responders can claim exceptions in certain circumstances (and thus not supply information as requested). Exceptions under this Act and the Regulations relate to sensitive information only.3.1. 
Where the exceptions apply, a Category 1 or 2 responder must not disclose the information:o exception where disclosure would prejudice sensitive information:a Category 1 or 2 responder must refuse to comply with an information request if the information is sensitive and if it has reasonable grounds to believe that complying with the request would compromise that information. If a Category 1 or 2 responder refuses to disclose information on this basis, it must give reasons for so doing, unless the information is sensitive by virtue of its impact on national security. 9 It should be noted, however, that this exception is only rarely likely to be available, as generally there will be no robust reason to expect that information would be passed on.3.26. There are four different kinds of sensitive information as defined by the Regulations: 10o information prejudicial to national security – information, where disclosure to the public would adversely affect national security.o information prejudicial to public safety – information, where disclosure to the public would adversely affect public safety.o commercially sensitive information – information which relates to the business or other affairs of a person or organisation, where disclosure to the public would prejudice the legitimate business interests of the person or organisation to whom the information relates.o personal data – information which is personal data within the meaning of the DPA, where disclosure to the public would breach any of the data protection principles or section 10 of the DPA.9 regulation 45(1)10 regulation 45(1)
3.27. It will be for individual Category 1 or 2 responders to reach a decision about whether the information they hold is sensitive. But there are a number of general points that should affect the decision:o all Category 1 and 2 responders should work on the presumptionthat information requested should be disclosed. Non-disclosure should only occur in exceptional cases, such as where there are clear national security or commercial implications.o where the Category 1 or 2 responder knows that the information has originated from the intelligence services and that disclosureto the public would threaten national security, then the information must not be disclosed unless consent is obtained from the originating services. Where the Category 1 or 2 responder suspects that the information has originated from the intelligence services, or that it may be sensitive for reasons of national security, it should consult with the originator of the information.o in considering national security implications, note that the test is whether disclosure to the public would threaten national security, not whether disclosure to the requesting Category 1 or 2 responder would threaten national security. A similar test applies in the other categories of sensitive information.o in the case of information that is sensitive by virtue of its national security implications, a Minister of the Crown may issue a certificate certifying that disclosure of that information to the public would be contrary to the interests of national security. This certificate is conclusive. The Minister can issue a certificate in relation to a class of information or a specific piece of information. Note, however, that absence of ao 
certificate does not mean that the information cannot be sensitive on national security grounds.11o where a request relates to information, part of which is sensitive and part of which is not, the exception only applies to the sensitiveinformation. (In other words, the application of an exception does not necessarily enable a Category 1 or 2 responder to refuse an information request in its entirety).Using non-sensitive information within the planning process3.28. The Act and Regulations do not impose any limits on the use of information obtained under the Act which is not sensitive. However, use of non-sensitive information may be limited by duties of confidence, by other enactment or by contract.3.29. There are unlikely to be any restrictions on the use to which a Category 1 or 2 responder can put any non-sensitive information which it creates in the course of carrying on its duties under the Act; for example an emergency plan – though an emergency plan may contain information that has been supplied by another Category 1 or 2 responder, and the use to which this information may be put may be subject to limits. It is also important to be mindful that information is sensitive within different environments, and whilst some information may be suitable for sharing among Category 1 or 2 responders, it might not be suitable for the wider public.11 regulation 46
Disclosure of non-sensitive information3.30. Neither the Act nor the Regulations place any restriction on the disclosure of non-sensitive information that is obtained under the Act. Nor do the Act or Regulations create any restriction on disclosure of non-sensitive information that is created by a Category 1 or 2 responder in the course of carrying out its functions under the Act. However, non-sensitive information which is received from other Category 1 or 2 responders or third parties may be subject to a duty of confidence or contractual restrictions on disclosure. Category 1 or 2 responders may also be subject to other statutory restrictions on disclosure.3.31. Just because there is no restriction on disclosure, this does not necessarily mean that the Category 1 or 2 responder will be obliged to disclose the information. But some Category 1 or 2 responders may be under a legal obligation to disclose certain information – in particular, under the Act (see, for example, the duty to arrange to publish in part the plans and risk assessments),12 the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR).13Using sensitive information within the planning process
3.32. 12 s. 2(1)(f)13 S.I.2004/3391
If a Category 1 responder asks for sensitive information for the purpose of performing a particular function under its regulatory regime, that information may only be used for that purpose. 14 The effect of this will be to limit the circulation of information within Category 1 responder organisations. For example, information about the robustness of mobile phone coverage in the event of an emergency, legitimately obtained by one part of an organisation for use in emergency plans, should not be shared with another part of the organisation responsible for the organisation’s contractual relationship with its mobile phone provider.
14 regulation 52(1)
3.33. If a Category 1 or 2 responder wishes to use sensitive information it has received by virtue of an information request under the Act for a different purpose, it must3.1. 
obtain the consent of the relevant person or organisation.15
The relevant person
or organisation for different types of sensitive information is set out in Figure 3.1.3.34. The use of sensitive information may be further restricted by duties of confidence, by other enactment or by contract.3.35. Restrictions on the disclosure of sensitive information which is created by a Category 1 or 2 responder in the course of carrying out its duties under the Act are dealt with below. This is likely to limit the way in which sensitive information created by a Category 1 or 2 responder is used.Disclosure of sensitive information3.36. The Regulations prohibit any Category 1 and 2 responder from publishing or otherwise disclosing any sensitive information which it has received by virtue of the Act. 16 The Regulations also prohibit disclosure of any sensitive information which the Category 1 or 2 responder has created in the course of discharging its duties under the Act.17 For example, a risk assessment might identify that a local authority’s planning to evacuate a city centre was deficient, and would exacerbate the effects of a terrorist attack. Putting the information into the public domain could expose a weakness that might encourage an attack. If this information was obtained by virtue of an information request made under the Act, or created in the course of a Category 1or 2 responder discharging its duties under the Act, the sensitive information must not be disclosed, even if it would otherwise fall within the Category 1 responder’s duty to publish a risk assessment/plan or its duty to warn, inform and advise the public.15 regulation 52(2)16 regulation 51(1)17 regulation 51(5)
3.37. There are two exceptions in the Regulations to the prohibition on disclosure.Where the exceptions apply, the Category 1 or 2 responder may disclose. But unless the Category 1 or 2 responder is subject to an obligation under the Act to disclose the information (eg as part of the obligation to publish risk assessments), it is not obliged to do so:o consent for the publication or disclosure is obtained. Consent should be obtained from the person identified in Figure 3.1. Note that the consent may be given subject to conditions. 18o the information is commercially sensitive or personal data, but the public interest in disclosure outweighs the interests of the person or organisation concerned. This exception does not apply if the information is sensitive by virtue of its national security or public safety implications. When relying on this exception, the Category 1 or 2 responder must inform the person or organisation to whom the information relates of its intention to disclose the information and provide reasons why it is satisfied that the public interest in disclosure outweighs their interests. 193.38. The prohibition on disclosure applies when the Category 1 or 2 responder is discharging its duties under the Act or any other function that it has in relation to an emergency. The prohibition does not apply where a Category 1 or 2 responder is dealing with an information request under the Regulations or contributing to the Community Risk Register (CRR).18 regulation 51(2)19 regulation 51(6)PAGE 18
3.39. The prohibition will not apply where the Category 1 or 2 responder receives an information request under the FOIA or the EIR. In such circumstances, Category 1 or 2 responders must consider the relevant enactment to determine whether or not the information should be released (bearing in mind that the presumption under FOIA is that all information will be disclosed). The right to information under each of those enactments is subject to exemptions on disclosure. In many cases, these will apply to sensitive information; but Category 1 or 2 responders should consider each case on its merits.
3.40. 
The Regulations 20
deal with the sharing of risk assessments to form the CRR.
Where the risk assessment contains sensitive information, the Category 1 or 2 responder need not provide that information to the CRR where it considers that to do so would impair the confidentiality of that information or compromise the information. Note that there is no obligation under the Regulations to publish the CRR in its entirety. It is possible for a Category 1 or 2 responder to contribute a risk assessment to the CRR on condition that its risk assessment is not published.20 regulation 15(3)

3.41. 
This section outlines how the Government believes the duties described may best be carried out. It describes good practice. Category 1 responders must have regard to this guidance. 21
Types of Information3.42. It may be helpful for Category 1 and 2 responders to think about their use of information in the round, and consider how streams of information interact.3.1. 
21 s. 3(3)(b)
PAGE 20
3.43. There are various types of information. Information may be suitable for some audiences, but not others. And the circulation of information can be limited to certain classes of organisation or individual.3.44. It is important not to think of information as being either public or private. The picture is much more nuanced, with a spectrum which runs from limited-access information (even within organisations) through to information intended to be absorbed and understood by the public.3.45. However, there are certainly controls on the free flow of information. Access is limited in a range of ways including physical access, restrictive markings, circulation lists, the ‘need-to-know’ principle and targeting particular audiences.Protective markingThere are 6 key points for protectively marking material. These are:o Not Protectively Marked;o Protect;o Restricted;o Confidential;o Secret; ando Top Secret.The large range of information that can be covered by PROTECT means that a descriptor should be used e.g. “PROTECT - FOR LOCAL RESILIENCE FORUM USE ONLY”. Material which contains sensitive personal data should be marked “PROTECT – PERSONAL DATA”. The non-statutory guidance document, Security Vetting and Protective Markings: A guide for Emergency Responders, describes
the classification for each heading. It is however unlikely that responders will have a frequent need to work with highly classified material, but nevertheless, should understand the classification for each heading.Security vettingThere are three types of personnel security controls (vetting levels) that affect access to protectively marked information. These are:o Baseline Standard (BS) – previously known as Basic Check (BC) and also known as Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS). This standard may enable those who are cleared to have access upto CONFIDENTIAL and occasional controlled access to SECRET material.o Security Check (SC) - This standard may enable those who have been cleared to have long term, frequent and uncontrolled access to SECRET information or assets; and occasional controlled access to TOP SECRET.o Developed Vetting (DV) – This standard may enable those who are cleared to have long term, frequent and uncontrolled access to TOP SECRET information or assets.Incidents of a sensitive natureIn the rare case of an extremely sensitive incident, such as a nuclear or terrorist attack, it is important that Category 1 and 2 responders assess the appropriateness of clearances for staff and volunteers. This judgment must be based on how frequently staff are likely to come into contact with any sensitive information arising from the incident. Category 1 and 2 responders should be willing to challenge organisations which demand unwarranted levels of clearance.
Category 2 responders3.46. As with co-operation obligations, it is important for Category 1 responders to be realistic about what information is requested from Category 2 responders. Information sharing has the potential to be very burdensome if it is not handled responsibly.3.47. Category 2 responders often put information about their activities into the public domain.  Information about the overall regulatory regime for Category 2 responders such as the utility and transport sectors is also widely available. In the first instance, Category 1 responders should seek information about the civil protection arrangements of Category 2 responders from these open sources. To facilitate this, the Government will work with Category 2 responders to put as much information as practical about their industry’s civil protection arrangements into the public domain.3.48. Whilst Category 2 responders do not have the same planning duties as Category 1 responders, Category 2 responders do have a duty to provide information whenrequested by another responder 22 if the responder requires it:o to perform its duties under the CCA; oro in connection with the performance of another of its functions which relates to an emergency.22 regulation 44A, 47 (1), 49 (1), 50
If a request is made, the Category 2 responder must, unless the information is sensitive, comply with the request. In addition to the exceptions discussed elsewhere in this chapter, the regulations prevent a Category 2 responder providing information if they consider that:o the information requested is personal data and disclosure would contravene a data protection principle; oro disclosure would be likely to adversely affect the confidentiality of the information.In relation to information on vulnerable people, disclosure should not contravene a data protection principle. Provided that the requesting agency gives an assurance that the confidentiality of the information will not be breached, the Category 2 responder would be expected to provide the information as a general duty under the regulations.3.49. Beyond these generic arrangements, Category 1 responders can generally expect to be making information requests in a limited number of areas:o information about local configuration of national arrangements;o information about specific local facilities; ando contact details of key staff.3.50. Of course, this list is not exclusive. If a Category 1 responder wants information in order to discharge its duties under the Act, it should approach the Category 2 responder in question and begin a dialogue about access. If that is not possible, or is unsuccessful, and the Category 1 responder believes the request to be3.1. 
reasonable and appropriate, it should make the request in accordance with the procedures set out above.3.51. Where possible, Category 1 responders should seek to channel requests through as small a number of routes as possible to avoid duplication of effort. There are several ways in which Category 1 responders can request access to information to make the process more efficient:o where the information is required by a number of Category 1 responders, the request may be co-ordinated through the Local Resilience Forum (LRF), with the information shared between LRF members if appropriate. This is particularly relevant if the questions relate to local arrangements.o across more than one LRF area, the request could be co-ordinated through any multi-agency or multi-LRF groups.o where a type of information request comes up repeatedly, a Category 1 responder should consider raising this with its national representative body, or the sponsoring government department, or through the national representative body for theCategory 2 sector in question. This will allow the sector to consider whether adjustment might be made to the scope of publicly available information to remove the need for future requests.3.52. In terms of sensitive information, most Category 2 responders are particularly likely to rely on exceptions that relate to commercial confidentiality. This reflects the fact that many of the Category 2 responders are private sector bodies, who may be in competition with other Category 2 responders within the same area. It is important that these needs are respected. For example, two mobile3.1. 
phone operators in the same LRF area might not want to expose details of their network coverage to each other, or to the public.3.53. This would obviously be less true of those Category 2 responders from the public sector.3.54. Category 1 responders should also bear in mind that information may be available to their organisation by virtue of existing commercial relationships with a Category 2 responder, or that information might be shared under the Act which would affect a commercial relationship. For example, an electricity supplier might have a contract to supply a local authority, but civil protection work might reveal problems with the resilience of that supply.3.55. It is important that Category 1 responders respect the circumstances under which such information is obtained, and abide carefully by any restrictions on its use. Should Category 1 responders not handle information properly, the sanctions set out in the Act 23 might be available to the Category 2 responder in question. In addition, if information is disclosed in breach of any duty of confidence, action may be taken against the responder in breach.3.56. In return for responsible use of these powers to request information, Category 2 responders should ensure that they can deal with reasonable requests made by Category 1 responders.Exercising (validation, training and testing)3.57. The regulations clarify the requirements in regard to the arrangements for exercises not only to ensure that emergency plans are effective, but also that23 s. 10
training for Category 1 personnel and other persons whom the responder considers necessary should also be provided. In addition, whilst not all elements of the plan can be tested, crucial elements of the plan can. One of these elements is information management.3.58. It is vital that all Category 1 and 2 responders have an awareness of their roles and are reasonably comfortable with them before an incident occurs. Category1 and 2 responders should receive awareness training in understanding and interpreting the legislation relating to information sharing i.e. under the CCA, DPA, FOIA and EIR. In addition, lessons and experience from previous incidents should also be included in any training and exercising of plans. Reference should be made to the use of national reports and recommendations from major incidents.3.59. Category 1 and 2 responders should regularly review their training and exercising programme to validate, exercise and test the information sharing and also interoperability of communications elements of an emergency plan. In undertaking such a review, it is essential that responders understand their role and can fulfil its purpose before an incident occurs.Other legislative requirements3.60. Although there are many pieces of legislation which affect the use of information within individual sectors, there are three which have a wider-ranging impact and of which, as a consequence, Category 1 and 2 responders should be aware. It is for each Category 1 or 2 responder to make the final judgements about the detailed implications of each of these pieces of legislation and how they interface with the Act.3.1. 
Freedom of Information Act 20003.61. FOIA provides a mechanism by which members of the public can access information held by public sector bodies.3.62. The FOIA aims to increase the transparency of public bodies and the way in which such bodies carry out their work, and to increase accountability. For Category 1 and 2 responders which are public authorities as defined by the FOIA – broadly speaking that is a UK-wide public authority or a public sector body in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (similar legislation exists in Scotland) – the FOIA imposes certain duties to communicate information which is requested by any person (subject to procedural requirements and exemptions). These duties are not affected by the Act.3.63. Although as a matter of law the FOIA could be used by one public authority to extract information from another, the FOIA is not primarily intended to be used for that purpose. Public authorities have an implicit duty of co-operation in the discharge of public functions which should facilitate information flow. As such, public authorities which are Category 1 or 2 responders should not regard the FOIA as the principal basis for making requests from each other about civil protection matters. Category 2 responders which are not public authorities should also not rely on the provisions of the FOIA as the principal basis to acquire information for civil protection purposes.3.64. Instead, Category 1 and 2 responders should follow the two-stage process set out in earlier paragraphs. In the first instance, they should consider whether it is possible to get the information they seek through other means.3.1. 
3.65. It is only if the information is not publicly or informally available that Category 1 or 2 responders should seek to use the formal mechanisms set out above. But this remains a last resort.3.66. In most respects, the information sharing provisions in the Act and Regulations are broader than those in the FOIA. The FOIA recognises that the information will enter the public domain. The Act recognises that the information stays within the civil protection community. As a result, the Act allows certain types of sensitive information to be shared which would be unlikely to be disclosed under FOIA.3.67. It is important however that WRF, LRFs and any multi LRF group agree protocols for dealing with individual FOIA requests. This will ensure that multi-LRF, WRF or LRF responders who receive the same individual FOIA request from the public or media can produce a co-ordinated response to the request. The process may mean identifying a lead responder to deal with specific FOIA requests on behalf of the multi LRF/WRF or LRF responders bearing in mind what can and cannot be disclosed under the CCA.3.68.

 Chapter 4 Local responder risk assessment dutyRevision to Emergency PreparednessCivil Contingencies Act Enhancement ProgrammeMarch 2012
Chapter 4 (Local responder risk assessment duty) ofEmergency Preparedness, Revised Versionï SummaryRisk assessment is the first step in the emergency planning and business continuity (BC) planning processes. It ensures that Category 1 responders make plans that are sound and proportionate to risks (paragraphs 4.1-4.5).ï The Act places a duty on all Category 1 responders to carry out risk assessment.Multi-agency co-operation in maintaining a Community Risk Register is also a statutory duty (paragraphs 4.9-4.10).ï There is a six-step process for risk assessment that reflects widely accepted good practice. It involves a cycle of identifying potential hazards within the local context, assessing the risks, and considering how those risks should be managed. Responders can use these steps to assist their own planning (paragraphs 4.29-4.56 and Box 4.6).ï Local risk assessments should inform multi-LRF and national assessments, and vice versa.Category 1 responders will be able to draw on generic risk assessments and other sources of information (Box 4.5) that are provided by central government, while local risk assessments will be shared with Government via the Department for Communities and Local Government (Resilience and Emergencies Division DCLG RED). These may then be used to inform multi-LRF and national risk assessments (Boxes 4.2 and 4.3).
Box 4.1: Further advice and information WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE	Scope of the duty4.1. The Act places a risk assessment duty on all Category 1 responders. The purpose of the duty is to:o ensure that Category 1 responders have an accurate and shared understanding of the risks that they face so that planning has a sound foundation and is proportionate to the risks;o provide a rational basis for the prioritisation of objectives and work programmes and the allocation of resources;o enable Category 1 responders to assess the adequacy of theirplans and capabilities, highlight existing measures that are appropriate, and allow gaps to be identified;
o facilitate joined-up local planning, based on consistent planning assumptions;o enable Category 1 responders to provide an accessible overview of the emergency planning and business continuity planning context for the public and officials ando inform and reflect national risk assessments that support emergency planning and capability development at those levels.Assess the risk of an emergency4.2. There is a duty on Category 1 responders to assess the risk of an emergency within, or affecting, a geographical area for which each Category 1 responder isresponsible.1 The source of risk includes both hazards and threats. Hazards aredefined as non-malicious events including natural events, industrial accidents and industrial action. Threats are defined as malicious attacks. Emergency, as defined in the Act, is an event or situation which threatens serious damage to human welfare in a place in the United Kingdom, an event or situation which threatens serious damage to the environment of a place in the United Kingdom, or war, or terrorism, which threatens serious damage to the security of the United Kingdom.2 It must also meet either of the following criteria:o The threat or hazard is of a sufficient scale and nature that it is likely to seriously obstruct a Category 1 responder in the performance of its functions.o The threat or hazard requires the Category 1 responder to exercise its functions and undertake a special mobilisation.31 s.2 (1)(a)-(b), regulation 132 s.13 s. 2(2)
4.3. Challenges which do not constitute an emergency as defined under the Act lie outside the scope of the risk assessment duty. As part of business continuity management (BCM), Category 1 responders will need to risk-assess their emergency planning arrangements and their ability to deliver their critical functions during those emergencies for which the risks are assessed to be significant. Henceforth, in this chapter, ‘hazards’ and ‘threats’ are events which may result in an emergency, as defined above.Modification of plans4.4. Category 1 responders are required to consider whether plans should be modified in light of the risk assessment. 4Plan for response to an emergency4.5. Category 1 responders need only perform a risk assessment in relation to emergencies which would or might affect the geographical area for which they are responsible.5 This includes risk sources both within and outside an LRF border including critical national infrastructure (CNI).Minister of the Crown4.6. The Regulations enable a Minister of the Crown to issue Category 1 responders with guidance on the risk of a particular emergency. This guidance will usually take the form of likelihood and impact assessments. The Minister may provide that Category1 responders must adopt that assessment as their own. In general, this is the approach that will be used for the assessment of risks associated with threats; central government will provide statements of the likelihood and impacts of broad threat4 s. 2(1)(e)5 regulation 13
categories within the Local Risk Assessment Guidance (LRAG) 6 and the National Risk Register (NRR).7 Planning figures for the generic consequences of these threats categories are provided in the National Resilience Planning Assumptions (NRPAs).8 In these cases, a responder must not assess the likelihood of that emergency occurring itself; it must rely on the Ministerial assessment.4.7. Alternatively, the Minister may provide that Category 1 responders must “have regard” to the Ministerial assessment. In such cases, responders must conduct a subsequent risk assessment of their own. They must take the Ministerial assessment into account, but if there are particular reasons to depart from that assessment (e.g. because there are peculiar local features which have not been taken into account in the Ministerial assessment), a responder may do so. This is how generic local likelihood assessments of hazards - in the form of the LRAG - will be provided to Category 1 responders in the Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) by the government departments and agencies that are best placed to make those assessments (e.g. the Environment Agency for coastal flooding, and the Health and Safety Executive for industrial accidents).Frequency4.8. The Act also states that the risk assessment should be updated “from time to
time”. 9
This must be interpreted in light of the purpose of the risk assessment
duty and the duty on responders to perform their duties under the Act in a “reasonable fashion”. Thus, Category 1 responders should assess risk as often as is necessary, taking into account the annually updated Local Risk Assessment Guidance (LRAG), to ensure that they are in a reasonable position to maintain and6 The LRAG is issued by the Cabinet Office and is designed to inform LRF risk assessments. It contains information on the likelihood and impact of generic threats and hazards and is updated annually See Box 4.4.7 The NRR is the public version of the NRA. It contains a high level overview of the risks to the UK as well as giving advice on how businesses, communities and individuals can better prepare for emergencies. It is issued approximately every two years. It can be found at http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource- library/national-risk-register. See Box 4.4.8 National Resilience Planning Assumptions provide information and planning figures for the generic consequences of risks. It is based upon the NRA and is published annually to reflect changes in the risk assessment.9 s. 2(1)(a)-(b)
update their emergency plans and to perform the civil protection duties under the Act, including the duty to maintain Business Continuity plans. However, the risk assessment should respond quickly to changes in the risk environment so that plans can be updated10accordingly. This means that the process should be iterative and contain risk monitoring and updating mechanisms (see paragraph 4.55).Co-operation4.9. As part of the LRF process, Category 1 responders must co-operate with each other in maintaining the Community Risk Register (CRR).11 The CRR provides an agreed position on the risks affecting a local area and on the planning and resourcing priorities required to prepare for those risks. Its purpose is to enable each Category 1 responder to:o be fully informed of the risks of emergency in its area;o benefit from the range of views on risk of its partners on the LRF;o identify collectively the main local emergency plans and capabilities which appear to be needed across all the Category 1 responders;o decide which of the plans and capabilities should properly fall to it;12ando know which of its partners in the LRF acknowledges responsibility for developing plans and capabilities against the various risks.4.10. According to the Regulations, the CRR should be shared with LRFs with whom a boundary is shared.13 A copy of the CRR should also be provided to the Department for Communities and Local Government Resilience and Emergencies Division for distribution to others as necessary. This may include Cabinet Office and other government departments, as well as other LRFs who do not necessarily share10 s. 2(1)(e)11 regulation 1512 s. 2(1)(b)13 regulation 16
geographical boundaries with the CRR area. Indeed, Category 1 responders should consider whether there are any specific risks which should be communicated to any LRFs in any other local areas.144.11. While the Act imposes a duty on each Category 1 responder to assess risk, it is recognised that requiring each Category 1 responder to perform this duty in isolation would lead to a wasteful duplication of resources. It is more efficient for individual Category 1 responders to fulfil their risk assessment duties by participating in a collaborative exercise that results in a single, collective risk assessment. This ensures that each local risk is assessed once only and allows the workload to be shared between Category 1 responders. It also helps to streamline the relationship between Category 1 responders and the government departments and agencies that are able to support the risk assessments.4.12. In light of this, the Regulations enable the risk assessment duty to be exercised in diff15erent ways. The Act provides that Category 1 responders may fulfil the duty to assess risk jointly. For example, a number of Category 1 responders in the form of a subgroup of the LRF might collectively assess the risk of a particular emergency occurring. Alternatively, the Act enables one Category 1 responder to be identified with lead responsibility.16 This is the mechanism that may be used by LRF members to share the risk assessment activity between them, with each member taking lead responsibility for a number of the risks. However, as outlined below, it will be for each Category 1 responder to assess whether a given risk poses a challenge for that particular responder.14 regulation 1815 regulation 816 regulations 9-11
4.13. In addition, a Category 1 responder may engage a third party (e.g. an external consultant) to provide it with advice that relates to the risk of a particular emergency occurring. The Category 1 responder may then rely on this advice in making its own risk assessment. However, Category 1 responders should remember the benefits of conducting this process themselves: increased stakeholder engagement, a deeper understanding of the risk assessment, and enhanced credibility when communicating and explaining the assessment.Publication of risk assessments4.14. The Act requires each Category 1 responder to arrange to publish all or part of its risk assessments.17 It can do this (by agreement with its LRF partners) by publishing all or part of the CRR. It may also fulfil the duty by publishing all or part of a plan, where the part published includes a summary of the risk assessment on which the plan is based. When deciding what may be published, the security classification of information and any restrictions on the disclosure of sensitive information should be taken into consideration (see paragraph 4.57)How the Act and the Regulations Apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland4.15. The extent of the risk assessment duty under the Act and the application of this guidance differ between the devolved administrations.Scotland4.16. Category 1 responders in Scotland have a duty to undertake risk assessment. The Resilience Division and sector policy areas of the Scottish Government work closely with Strategic Co-ordinating Groups (LRF equivalents) and national agencies to17 s. 2(1)(f)
4.16. deliver resilience activities in Scotland. The guidance Preparing Scotland has been centrally produced by the Scottish Government in partnership with Category 1 responders to support them to undertake these statutory duties.4.17. Information on hazard and threat assessments for the UK is provided to the Scottish Government in the form of the LRAG, the National Risk Register and National Resilience Planning Assumptions. These are circulated to Strategic Co-ordinating Groups via the Scottish Government’s Resilience Division. This material will be issued direct by a Minister to Category 1 responders which fall outside devolved competence.Wales4.18. The Act, Regulations and guidance extend to Wales. To assist Category 1 responders to fulfil their risk assessment duty, the Welsh Government will be provided with information on hazard and threat assessments in the form of the LRAG, the National Risk Register and National Resilience Planning Assumptions, to cascade to Category 1 responders in Wales. The Welsh Government may issue its own risk assessments to responders in Wales, with the consent of the Minister of the Crown. In certain circumstances, a Minister of the Crown may also provide guidance direct to Category 1 responders in Wales. From time to time, the CRR should also be shared with LRFs with whom a boundary is shared, and a copy provided to the Welsh Government.18Northern Ireland4.19. In Northern Ireland, only a limited number of organisations have duties under Part 1 of the Act. (For further details see Chapter 12.)18 regulation 16
4.20. To assist those Category 1 responders who do have a duty to undertake risk assessment, information on hazard and threat assessments will be provided to them direct. They will also be provided to the Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (CCPB) and the Department of Justice for information purposes.4.21. Because these organisations do not represent the full spectrum of responders, not all the duties placed on organisations elsewhere will be appropriate in Northern Ireland. In particular, the provisions in the Regulations relating to the LRF and its activities, including the production of a CRR, do not apply to responders in Northern Ireland.4.22. However, the Category 1 responders are expected to carry out individual risk assessments in relation to their own functions, and in doing so, they should co-operate, as appropriate, with each other. The Category 2 responders should4.16. 
also co-operate with the Category 1 responders as required.19
In carrying out
their risk assessment, Category 1 responders must have regard to any assessment of which they are aware by one of the specified Northern Ireland public service bodies and may adopt or rely on that work.204.23. Organisations in Northern Ireland which deliver relevant devolved functions (with the exception of the Police Service of Northern Ireland) are not subject to the duties in Part 1 of the Act, but carry out their civil contingencies activities in line with the Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework. Powers under the Civil Contingencies Act to give directions and guidance to the PSNI in relation to its devolved functions lie with the Department of Justice, as set out in Chapter 12.19 regulation 620 Part 10 of the Regulations
4.24. The Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework requires organisations to carry out individual risk assessments in relation to their functions. The methodology specified in the Framework is similar to that used by Category 1 responders. The Framework encourages organisations to co-operate in producing risk assessments and to share information at local level. Further information can be found on the CCPB website http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-government-work/civil- contingencies.htmlFigure 4.1: Risk as a product of likelihood and impact
Terminology4.26. Key terms applying to the process are defined in the Glossary. Risk terminology is notoriously varied. However, this chapter aims to be consistent with the main standards relating to risk management.Figure 4.2: The general risk management process4.27. It should be noted that, in the Act, risk itself is defined solely as the probability of an emergency 21 (see paragraph 4.2). The definition of risk used in this chapter is aligned with a more common definition in use but is, to all intents and purposes, consistent. Here, risk is defined as a product of the likelihood and impact of a given hazard or threat.21 s. 2(1)(a)
4.28. Generally, higher risks are associated with hazards or threats that have a higher impact and medium to high likelihood. Conversely, low risks will reflect hazards and threats where the impact is low and the likelihood is low to medium. The more difficult cases are those hazards and threats where the likelihood is low and the impact very high, or vice versa. These risks defy simple categorisation. They require a more sophisticated means of measurement involving judgements about the overall risk associated with certain combinations of likelihood and impact. Typically, these judgements are presented in a risk matrix, as seen in Annex 4F.The risk assessment process4.29. Here, risk assessment is one component of the general risk management process as set out in Figure 4.2. The dashed line represents transitions from one phase to another: the first phase is ‘contextualisation’, the second ‘risk evaluation’ and the third ‘risk treatment’. It should be noted that there is no statutory requirement for Category 1 responders to perform the risk treatment step. However, it is described below for completeness and because, in practice, Category 1 responders are likely to use this step as a bridge to the emergency planning duty.4.30. The risk assessment phases can be described as follows:o Contextualisation involves defining the nature and scope of the risk and agreeing how the risk management process will be undertakeno Risk evaluation covers the identification of those threats and hazards that present significant risks, analysis of their likelihood and impacts, and the combination of these values to produce overall risk scores.o 
o Risk treatment involves deciding which risks are unacceptably high, developing plans and strategies to mitigate these risks, and then testing the plans and any associated capabilities. The National Resilience Planning Assumptions (NRPAs) set national and regional figures for the common consequences of risk which should be planned for. Together with the Local Planning Assumptions Guidance, the NRPAs can be tailored to inform local plans and strategies.It is important to note that the Act does not require Category 1 responders to take action to reduce the likelihood of threats and hazards. Category 1 responders may decide to do this as part of their treatment of assessed risks but the Act only requires that emergency plans be developed: prevention and pre-emption lie outside its scope.4.31. All three phases should be cyclical and interactive, involving the full range of stakeholders and allowing for review and updating. Moreover, the entire risk management process must be cyclical if it is to retain currency. Risks vary with changes in the context, changes in the hazards and threats, and changes in available emergency plans and capabilities. Thus, periodic reviews are required to ensure that these changes are captured, and then reflected in the risk assessment and emergency planning processes (see step 6, Annex 4A).Box 4.2: Consistency with UK and multi-LRF risk assessments

Supporting the planning process4.32. As Figure 4.3 illustrates, risk assessment should drive a standard emergency planning process, informing emergency plans (and BC plans) which are then tested through audit and validation exercises. Regular updating of the risk assessment 22 in turn leads to the revision of plans and further testing. A fundamental principle of emergency planning and business continuity planning is to address common consequences rather than different causes. As far as possible, flexible, generic plans may be developed to deliver the response capabilities for managing these consequences, whatever causes them. However, to ensure that these generic plans are commensurate with the risks, it is important that planning is underpinnedby a risk assessment 22 that evaluates and prioritises those hazards and threatsaccording to their associated risks.Figure 4.3: The location of risk assessment in the emergency planning process22 s. 2(1)(e)
Organisation and accountability4.33. It is likely that the LRF would wish to set up a Risk Assessment Working Group (RAWG), composed of a representative group of emergency planning officers from Category 1 responders, to undertake this work under a chair appointed by the LRF. As with the LRF, this working group is simply a forum for co-operation on risk assessment. Accordingly, the CRR is not owned by the LRF but by Category 1 responders in the LRF collectively.Rigour and proportionality4.34. The risk assessment process should be based on a sound methodology using the best available evidence and judgment. Category 1 responders should be supported in their assessment by Category 2 responders, local bodies, DCLG RED and national organisations sharing information and co-operating as appropriate. However, as far as possible, the amount of effort given to any risk should be proportionate to its potential severity.The six-step process(See also Annex 4A)Step 1: Contextualisation4.35. In an initial discussion at the RAWG, Category 1 responders should begin by defining the scope of the risk management activity in the context of the Act and supporting guidance. They should review the process that they will adopt and identify the project’s stakeholders. Key stakeholder groups must include the Category 1 responders who share the risk assessment duty, and may include Category 24.26. 
organisations with a contribution to the risk assessment process, as well as groups in the community with relevant knowledge and a particular interest in the results of the work (see 4.56). It is important that Category 1 responders understand, at the outset, the risk evaluation criteria and principles with which risks will be evaluated and prioritised (see Annexes 4D and 4F). This should prepare them for later stages of the process, in which they will need to decide which risks are acceptable and those which must be tolerated, including those which require planning.4.36. An important part of step 1 is for Category 1 responders to describe the characteristics of the local area that will influence the likelihood and impact of an emergency in the community. This is to understand the context better, as well as to establish the vulnerability and resilience of the area to emergencies. To do this Category 1 responders should reflect on a number of aspects of their area, including:o Social: What is the demographic, ethnic and socio-economic composition of the community? Are there any particularly vulnerable groups in the community? How are the various communities geographically distributed within the local area? How prepared and experienced is the community at coping with different typesof emergencies?o Environment: Are there any particular local vulnerabilities(e.g. poor coastal defences against flooding)? Is the area urbanised, rural or mixed? Are there any Sites of Special Scientific Interest?o Infrastructure: How is the infrastructure configured in the area (transport, utilities, business, etc)? What are the critical supply networks in the area? Are there any sites in the area that are particularly critical for local and national essential services (e.g. telecommunications hubs, health, finance, legal, etc)? What type ofo 
economy does it have? How prepared and experienced are the businesses in the area at coping with different types of emergency?o Hazardous sites: What potentially hazardous sites exist in the area?Where are they in relation to communities or sensitive environmental sites?Step 2: Hazard review and allocation for assessmentHazards4.37. Taking into account centrally provided guidance, in the form of the LRAG (see Box 4.4), each Category 1 responder should consider the local context as described during step 1 and identify those non-malicious hazards that, in their view, present  significant risks (i.e. could give rise to an emergency) in their areas over the next five years. These hazards will be identified on the basis of experience, research or other information (including from the community itself) and they are likely to present consequences to which a special mobilisation by the Category 1 responder is required.4.38. The RAWG should share and discuss these hazards at a meeting of the LRF with a view to agreeing a list of hazards to be assessed. The LRF should endorse the list of hazards, and determine which Category 1 responder will lead the assessment of each hazard on behalf of the group. The LRF will also need to decide how any additional hazards proposed by the RAWG should be assessed, whether by the appointment of a lead, delegation or otherwise.4.26. 
Box 4.3: longer term considerationsCategory 1 responders should consider these aspects in the context of the current situation, but with regards to emerging trends and future events. They are also encouraged to take into account the longer-term risk context. Climate change, although not a risk considered in the time frames of the local risk assessment cycle, is a major driver of many of the risks that LRFs do consider Consideration of this longer term risk will allow responders to identify capability gaps and risk reduction measures that may need to be tackled over a longer term period. For example, will present coastal defences be sufficient over a longer term horizon. A suggested timeframe for longer term risk contextualisation is 20 years. The National Security Risk Assessment, first published in 2010, evaluates risk over the same timescale and can be drawn upon to inform longer term contextualisation. Other factors that may define the time frame of longer term contextualization include the expected service lifetime of buildings, plants and equipment. This consideration of longer term risk drivers, is not a statutory part of the risk assessment process and should be included at the discretion of the LRF.4.39. When overall risk scores are calculated at a later stage, events that are low in likelihood but high in impact will not score highly, implying a need for planning cannot be justified (e.g. asteroids hitting the earth). This is not to say that all low likelihood, high impact events should be excluded, but a careful judgment is needed about the likelihood below which events will be excluded from the assessment. It would be good practice to maintain a register of excluded risks as an appendix to the CRR; this would allow Category 1 responders to demonstrate that certain risks were considered at the outset but were then discounted for specified reasons (e.g. an assumption that the likelihood was so small that the hazard did not warrant further attention).4.26. 
4.40. The responsibilities of the lead assessors would be to:o assess the likelihood and impact of each hazard, based on the knowledge of RAWG members, the generic likelihood assessment (where available) and any other relevant information;o liaise with the relevant government departments or agencies, as required;o document assessments using the individual risk assessment example (Annex 4C), which will support the CRR, containing more detailed information on the assessment;o present the likelihood assessment to the LRF and make changes as necessary;o capture the results of the LRF risk assessment in the CRR; ando ensure that the assessment is adequately described in the CRR.Box 4.4: Local Risk Assessment Guidance (LRAG)PAGE 22
Category 1 responders will receive Local Risk Assessment Guidance containing information on the likelihood and impact of generic threats and hazards. This guidance will be agreed each year in a process co- ordinated by the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat and involving representatives from the departments and agencies responsible for providing the assessments, as well as representatives of the local emergency planners, including first responders. It will be made available by the Cabinet Office in England, and the Welsh Government in Wales. (For further detail on arrangements in the devolved administrations, see paragraphs 4.15-4.24.)The framework is continually updated; Category 1 and 2 responders and other relevant parties are encouraged to put forward suggestions for improvements to the guidance. These will be fed back to the originating departments who will, where possible, reflect these suggestions in future versions of the guidance.Step 3: Risk analysisThreatsAssessing the likelihood of threats4.41. Category 1 responders should adopt the central government assessment, set out in the LRAG, of the likelihood of threats as categorised in the National Risk Register (NRR) (See Box 4.5). Guidance on publication of the threat assessment within the community risk register is detailed in section 4.574.26. 
Assessing the impact of threats4.42. For some categories of threat, LRFs may also weight the impact of a successful attack against local targets within their area. Information from the LRAG, the National Risk Register, National Resilience Planning Assumptions, Counter Terrorism Security Advisor (CTSAs 23) (Box 4.5 ) and local crowded places protectionprogrammes can be used to inform the impact assessment. 24Assessing the likelihood of hazards4.43. The RAWG lead assessors should consider the likelihood of the hazards occurring within the next five years (the same timescale adopted by the UK assessment). The LRAG from central government should provide a basis for this work but the local knowledge available in the RAWG and other local organisations (including Category 2 responders) should allow the RAWG to elaborate the assessment, and even to change it, if necessary.4.44. When assessing the likelihood of a hazard, it is necessary to refer to the description of an outcome of an incident. Without defining the outcome, it is more difficult to assess likelihood. For example, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of flooding in the next five years without defining the size of the flood incident to be assessed (small scale floods are more likely than larger scale floods). The outcome can be defined in various ways. For flooding, it may be appropriate to talk in terms of the area flooded. For many incidents, it may be necessary to use numbers of fatalities. Although both measures - area flooded and fatalities - are consequences of the hazards, they are immediate or primary consequences that can be used as proxy measures to describe the outcome of the hazard.

Box 4.5: Other sources of information to aid local risk assessmentThe National Risk Register (NRR)The National Risk Register (NRR) was first published in 2008 as part of the National Security Strategy which promised a publicly available assessment of the likelihood and potential impact of the range of threats and hazards the UK could face. Although intended to encourage public debate on security and help organisations, communities and individuals to prepare better for emergencies, the document is also important to LRFs in informing the local assessment of risks, particularly threat related risks. Indeed, the LRAG makes explicit reference to the NRR as an important tool in the risk assessment process.The National Risk Assessment (NRA)The National Risk Assessment (NRA) is the classified and detailed cross- government assessment of the risks facing the UK and is the basis of the public National Risk Register (NRR). It uses historical and scientific data and the professional judgments of experts to identify risks, assess the likelihood of the risk occurring and the impact if they do. The NRA is shared with all UK police forces. As well as informing police work, this will also give LRFs, the majority of which are chaired by the police, more direct access to the full assessment.The National Resilience Planning Assumptions (NRPAs) and Local Planning Assumption GuidanceThe National Resilience Planning Assumptions (NRPAs) provide information on the generic consequences of risks without disclosing the sensitive information on the causes of these consequences. Although the document
gives only national and sometimes multi-LRF planning figures, it is issued in tandem with the Local Planning Assumption Guidance which explains how the NRPAs should be interpreted and tailored to inform local planning assumptions. The guidance also explains how the Community Risk Register (CRR) rating matrix can be used to identify and define generic planning assumptions, providing a mechanism by which LRFs can use the output from the local risk assessment process better, to inform local planning.Counter Terrorism Security Advisors (CTSAs)CTSAs are embedded in all UK police forces. Their core role is to identify and assess local critical sites within their force area that might be vulnerable to terrorist or extremist attack; then devise and develop appropriate protective security plans to minimise impact on that site and the surrounding community. Additionally, the CTSA will promote awareness of the terrorist threat and develop positive ongoing relationships by appropriate discussion of changes in the prevailing terrorist threat and commensurate responses.4.45. The outcome of a hazard is not the same as its (wider) impact, which is considered later in the process, although there will usually be a close relationship between the two. For example, in the case of flooding, two flood events could havethe same outcome (e.g. 100 square miles flooded) but very different impacts, depending on the precise location of the flooding.
4.46. Where there is a considerable range in the foreseeable outcomes of a potential hazard, it may be necessary to assess the likelihood (and subsequently impact) of the hazard at multiple outcomes. Consequently, the individual risk assessment example at Annex 4C allows the lead assessors to record multiple outcomes for each hazard. Although a variety of outcomes may be considered for a particular type of risk, the LRF may decide that only a small number need to be captured in the CRR.4.47. Each assessment should be carried out by a group of professionals with a pragmatic mix of evidence and judgment, which should be documented as far as possible. Where appropriate, the assessments of likelihood will be informed by studies on the vulnerability (i.e. susceptibility to damage or harm) and resilience (ability to withstand damage or harm) of the relevant sites, systems and communities. The assessments of likelihood and of impact should adopt the scales provided at Annex 4D.4.48. It is possible that the generic local assessments of likelihood provided by central government in the LRAG will refer to outcomes of hazards that were not identified by the Category 1 responders. Category 1 responders can adopt different outcomes if they feel that this is necessary, but should document their reasons for doing so. It will not be possible for central government to re-issue the generic assessments with the revised outcomes, but it should be possible to take account of the new outcomes when agreeing the national risk assessment framework in subsequent years.Assessing the impact of hazards4.49. The next stage is to assess the impacts of the hazards. At Annex 4B, a generic framework is provided for assessing the local impacts of events in a consistent way. Using the impact scales provided, the lead assessors should assess the impact of hazards in their local areas.4.26.

Category 1 and 2 responders and other organisations engaged in response should not share risk assessments (either through the LRF or otherwise) if the information in the assessment is sensitive (e.g. commercially sensitive or relating to national security) and the responder has reason to believe that to do so would compromise the information. Chapter 3 provides further guidance.The lead assessors should capture the agreed likelihood and impact assessments in the individual risk assessment forms for consideration by the RAWG.Step 4: Risk evaluationOnce the RAWG has agreed the individual risk assessment forms, the results should be collated and incorporated in the CRR, unless sensitive. The level of risk can then be determined by plotting likelihood and impact scores for each hazard on a risk matrix (see Annex 4F). The production of a risk matrix is an essential part of the risk assessment process. Not only does it enable the risk analysis to be interpreted against pre-defined criteria, but it greatly facilitates the communication of the risk assessment. Annex 4F provides descriptions of the four risk ratings (‘Very high’, ‘High’, ‘Medium’ and ‘Low’) and addresses their relative significance for directing emergency planning.Note that in this risk matrix, the impact score is given a slightly greater weighting than the likelihood score. For example, an ‘Unlikely’ (2) but ‘Catastrophic’ (5) risk scores ‘Very high’, whereas a ‘Probable’ (5) but ‘Minor impact’ (2) risk scores ‘Medium’. The formula used to combine likelihood and impact scores varies from one risk assessment approach to another. The guidance presented here is consistent with a number of the major standards, and consistency in the application of this risk matrix is essential if the results of the local risk assessments are to be easily compared.
4.54. As regards threat information within the public community risk register, LRFs must refer directly to the NRR and include the related NRR threat statement provided by central government in the threat section of the LRAG. See Box 4.4.Box 4.6: National Resilience Extranet (NRE):Step 5: Risk treatment(See Box 4.7)Step 6: Monitoring and reviewing4.55. Risks should be reviewed regularly. Although there is no statutory requirement, it is recommended LRFs review risks in line with the annually updated Local Risk Assessment Guidance (LRAG). Risks should be monitored continuously and, where information suggests a potential change in the risks, a risk assessment should be4.54. 
performed and the CRR updated accordingly. This may require special meetings of the LRF, although risk assessment should be a standing item on the agendas of the LRFs. The CRR will also need to be updated periodically to reflect changes in the response capability (i.e. resilience). Consequently, the CRR should be seen as a living document and the work of the LRF as a rolling project.Sharing Risk Assessments4.56. Regulations require CRRs to be shared with LRFs in neighbouring local areas with whom a boundary is shared, and to the DCLG Resilience and Emergencies Division. In addition, Category 1 responders should consider whether there are any specific risks which should be communicated to any LRFs in any other local areas.Box 4.7: Risk treatment
In this stage of the risk assessment process, the LRF should prioritise risk reduction measures in accordance with the size of the risks and the gaps in the capabilities required to respond to those risks. This should take into account risks both in context of the current situation and consideration of the longer term risk context.This will allow responders to identify capability gaps and risk reduction measures that may need to be tackled over a longer term period. They should set the risk priorities and, having evaluated the treatment options, agree a risk treatment plan. All such judgements should be recorded in the CRR.The process has a number of stages that are described below. The results of each stage should be recorded in the CRR:o Assess the type and extent of the capabilities required to manage and respond to the hazards. The National Resilience Planning Assumptions together with Local Planning Assumptions Guidance can be used to inform local planning figures and will determine the level of capability required.o Identify the capabilities that are already in placeo Considering the gap and the extent of the risk, rate the risk priority.o Identify the additional treatments required to close the capability gap and manage the risk more effectively.o 
Publishing Risk Assessments4.57. A number of hazards a community may face, including pandemic influenza and wide-spread flooding, would be beyond the capacity of the emergency services, without the co-operation of the communities affected. The Community Risk Register, which Category 1 responders have a duty to publish, is an effective mechanism for making communities and businesses more aware and better able to prepare to play their part in emergency scenarios. LRFs are encouraged to increase awareness and engagement of the local community with the CRR by taking into account the principles of effective risk communication as documented on the UK resilience website http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/ communicating-risk-guidance. The webpage also gives examples of good practice that some LRFs have used in the production of their CRR. Category 1 responders are able to fulfil their statutory duty to publish all or part of their risk assessments by publishing all or part of the CRR or publishing all or part of a plan, where the part published includes a summary of the risk assessment 25 on which the plan is based. They should do so where such information is presented in such a way that informs and encourages members of the public to mitigate the consequences of risks in their area. They should also consider the security classification of the information and the restrictions on the disclosure of sensitive information (information disclosure of which would be damaging to national security or public safety or information which would be harmful to individuals or the commercial interests of any business entity.).25 s. 2(1)(f)

The following table is illustrative of the structure and type of content that is included in the Local Risk Assessment Guidance (LRAG). It identifies the types of hazard that Category 1 responders may wish to add to their Community Risk Registers, and an assessment of the likelihood of these risks occurring in a five- year timeframe in a typical Local Resilience Forum (LRF) area. It also sets out the assumptions which underpin the likelihood assessment and guidance on how this might vary through the country. It also provides information on generic threats for Category 1 responders.Category 1 responders are collectively responsible for maintaining a Community Risk Register (CRR). The LRAG is a guide which should assist Category 1 responders in compiling and assessing their CRRs. It provides a consistent basis for emergency planning across the LRF area.For each risk, the following descriptors are provided:o Risk identifier: Risks prefixed with ‘H’ are hazards which will require a national as well as a local response. Risks marked ‘HL’ would not ordinarily prompt a national response, and would usually be dealt with locally. Risks marked ‘T’ are threats which will require a national as well as a local response.o Risk category: This indicates the type of threat or hazard in question (e.g. terrorist attack, industrial accident, severe weather, public protests). Risk categories should be read in conjunction with outcome descriptions in order to understand the magnitude of the event.o 
Emergency Preparedness | Annex 4 B: Illustration of Local Risk Assessment Guidanceo Outcome description: This describes the immediate consequences or significance of the event. Outcome descriptions will often be expressed in terms of the facilities that have been destroyed, the numbers of fatalities and casualties, or extent of contamination. It is this information which enables the subsequent local impact assessment.o Variation and further information: This column focuses on the specific assumptions or causal events that drive the outcome description.Details are also given on the historical precedent and justification for the specific assumptions made.o Likelihood score and lead department: This column in the table gives the likelihood score of the risk arising, and the department or agency which has made this assessment. There is an important distinction in the treatment of likelihood assessments for threats and for hazards. In the case of hazards, the table provides an assessment of the likelihood of relevant risks occurring in a five-year timeframe in a typical LRF area.Likelihood assessments for hazards are presented on a 1-5 scale.o In the case of threats, the assessment of likelihoods is treated differently.The table does not show likelihood scorings for each threat event because doing so would be analytically misleading.o Likelihood rationale: This column in the table provides additional descriptive or statistical guidance on how the generic likelihood assessment was calculated. Each local area will wish to identify which of those threats and hazards listed could not occur in their area because it lacks particular sites or characteristics; and ultimately each LRF will need to decide on its own likelihood assessments. This will lead to a reduced set of assessed risks for most, if not all, local areas. The central government likelihood scores given are based upon the assessment of the risk outcome description occurring at any location across the UK. The figure provided is what policy experts assess to be the highest of allPAGE 42Last updated:March 2012
possible local level likelihoods for that specific scenario. While ratings at a local level will vary as each area is different, no local score should be greater than the national one. Clearly, where a local version of the hazard is being assessed at the LRF’s discretion and with potentially lesser impacts, the likelihood of that new, local risk, might well be greater.
4B.4.
The Local Risk Assessment Guidance will be issued annually. Feedback from Category 1 responders about how this guidance could be improved is welcomed and should be directed to the Civil Contingencies Secretariat in the Cabinet Office.

For malicious threats, LRFs are recommended to refer directly to the NRR, perhaps by including a link or reproducing the enclosed risks as assessed in the NRR matrix, using a modified form of the language previously recommended, along the following lines:“The NRR is a national picture, derived from the National Risk Assessment, of the risks of emergencies. The Matrix [here] gives an indication of the relative likelihood and impact of the high consequence risks that are outlined in the National Risk Register. It includes the risk of a number of kinds of terrorist attacks, shown here as attacks on crowded places, transport systems, and critical infrastructure, and attacks using non-conventional (or in other words chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) materials. In planning for emergencies [we] take into account the impact that such attacks would have in the local area as much as we do the impacts of other hazards of a more local nature”PAGE 61

These risks should be monitored to ensure that they are being appropriately managed and consideration given to their being managed under generic emergency planning arrangements.Low (L) risk - these risks are both unlikely to occur and not significant in their impact. They should be managed using normal or generic planning arrangements and require minimal monitoring and control unless subsequent risk assessments show a substantial change, prompting a move to another risk category.

Chapter 6 (Business Continuity Management) of Emergency Preparedness, Revised Version
 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE	Scope of the duty6.1. The Act requires Category 1 responders to maintain plans to ensure that they can continue to perform their functions in the event of an emergency, so far as is reasonably practicable.16.2. The duty to maintain plans relates to all the functions of a Category 1 responder, not just its civil protection functions. For Category 1 responders to help others in the event of an emergency, they first need to be able to keep their own crisis response capabilities going. However, Category 1 responders also need to be able to continue to deliver critical aspects of their day-to-day functions (e.g. law enforcement, looking after vulnerable people, attending minor fires) in the event of an emergency, if the impact on the community is to be kept to a minimum.
1 s.2(1)(c)
PAGE 3
6.3. It may, therefore, be helpful to think of the business continuity management (BCM) duty in the Act as being separated into two strands. In practice, the Act requires Category 1 responders to maintain plans to ensure that they can:o continue to exercise their civil protection functions: The legislation requires Category 1 responders to maintain plans to deal with emergencies (see Chapter 5) and put in place arrangements to warn and inform the public in the event of an emergency (see Chapter 7). The BCM duty requires Category 1 responders to maintain plans to ensure that they can deliver these capabilities when they are required.o continue to perform their ordinary functions: Category 1 responders perform a range of functions that are important to thehuman welfare and security of the community and its environment (e.g. provision of health care, detection of crime, fighting fires). This is particularly true in an emergency situation, where operational demands often increase and the operating environment canbecome more challenging. The legislation requires Category 1 responders to make provision for ensuring that their ordinary functions can be continued to the extent required.6.4. Organisations should not only look at the resilience of internal structures and processes, but also those of organisations they rely on, or deliver services through.6.5. The Act requires Category 1 responders to put in place plans to ensure that6.1. 
they can continue their functions in the event of an emergency.2
This requires

2 s.2(1)(c)
them to ensure that those organisations delivering services on their behalf (e.g. contracted-out services) or capabilities which underpin service provision (e.g. information technology and telecommunications providers) can deliver to the extent required in the event of an emergency. This is because services remain part
of an organisation’s functions even if they do not directly provide them.Limits of the dutyDefinition of emergency6.6. BCM is a flexible framework designed to help organisations to continue operating in the face of a wide range of different types of disruptions right the way along the spectrum of severity. BCM does not however embrace all dimensions of an organisation’s resilience, and one important distinction is between BCM and crisis management. The Publicly Available Specification on Crisis Management (PAS200) identifies crisis management as wider ranging and inherently strategic in nature. BCM in turn is a more operationally- focused activity to ensure that service disruptions are managed, potentially cascading impacts are mitigated and services are maintained. For further details and for guidance on developing a crisis management capability see http://epcollege.com/epc/news/ pas200-crisis-management---new-guidance-for-crisis/ (including link to the BSI website).6.7. The BCM duty, however, is determined by the definition of emergency in the Act. The Act therefore imposes a duty on Category 1 responders to put in place plans to ensure that they can continue to exercise their functions in the event of a much narrower range of disruptive challenges.36.8. The duty applies only to those events or situations defined as an emergency in section 1 of the Act - events or situations that threaten serious damage to the human welfare, environment or security of a place in the United Kingdom. This should be read in conjunction with section 2(2) of the Act, which provides that an event or situation is only an emergency when it overwhelms existing response arrangements, and cannot be dealt with within existing resources or procedures (see Chapter 1 for an in-depth description of the definition of “emergency” underpinning Part 1 of the Act).6.1. 
3 s.2(1)(c) and s.2(2)
PAGE 5
6.9. While the duty focuses on the most challenging situations, it is likely that plans put in place to fulfil their duty under the Act will help Category 1 responders to prepare for a much wider range of day-to-day (i.e. non-emergency) interruptions. By putting in place plans to keep themselves going in the event of an emergency, Category 1 responders will build resilience to a wider range of less serious events.Practicability6.10. Ideally, Category 1 responders would be able to continue all of their functions at ordinary service levels in the event of an emergency. In practice, this may not prove possible, and therefore the duty is qualified.6.11. The Act requires Category 1 responders to put in place arrangements to ensure that they continue to exercise their functions in the event of an emergency so far as is reasonably practicable.46.12. The qualification “so far as is reasonably practicable” has three elements to it:o Criticality: Category 1 responders should focus on ensuring thatthey can deliver critical functions. Which of its functions are critical is a matter that can be determined only by the organisation itself, and may depend on the nature of the emergency in question. Category 1 responders should not lose sight of the common supporting infrastructure underpinning these functions. The following guiding principles should be used when deciding whether or not a serviceor activity is critical. It is not intended to be a definitive list, but rather a series of useful indicators:4 s.2(1)(c)
ï Emergency management/civil protection: Functions that underpin the Category 1 responder’s capability to respond to the emergency itself, and take effective action to reduce, control or mitigate the effects of the emergency.ï Impact on human welfare, the environment and security: The significance of services to the effective functioning of the community in the event of an emergency, or an adverse effect on the environment.ï Legal implications: Statutory requirements on Category 1 responders and the threat of litigation if a service isnot delivered, or is delivered inadequately.ï Financial implications: Loss of revenue and payment of compensation.ï Reputation: Functions that impact on the credibility and public perception of a Category 1 responder.o Service levels: The Act does not require Category 1 responders to continue to deliver their functions at ordinary levels in the event of an emergency. Some critical functions may need to be scaled up, while others (which are non-critical) may need to be scaled down or suspended. Acceptable levels of service in the event of an emergency are a matter for the Category 1 responder itself to determine in the light of its capabilities, constraints and the needs of the community.o Balance of investments: No organisation will be in a position to commit unlimited resources to BCM. It is the role of the Category 1 responder itself to decide the level of protection sought.o 
6.13. Category 1 responders must therefore put in place a process for effectively managing the prioritisation of services - and getting high-level endorsement for these decisions - prior to an emergency occurring. The business impact analysis (BIA) process described later in this chapter gives a methodology for undertaking this work.Risk assessment6.14. It is important that Category 1 responders identify the significant risks threatening the performance of critical functions in the event of an emergency or disruption, as this will enable them to focus resources in the right areas, and develop appropriate continuity strategies.56.15. In this context, there are two strands to risk assessment, relating to external threats (i.e. risk of an emergency occurring) and internal risks (i.e. business risks) that could cause loss or disruption of critical services required to control, reduce or mitigate the effects of an emergency or disruption.6.16. The Act requires Category 1 responders to identify and assess significant risks of an emergency occurring in their area 6 - in accordance with their particular functions - as a basis for performing their other civil protection duties (see Chapter 4). The Regulations require Category 1 responders to have regard to assessments of risk maintained pursuant to the Act when developing BCPs.7 The Act requires Category 1 responders to consider whether a risk assessment6.1. 
makes it necessary or desirable to review a BCP.8
It is good practice, in any
instance, to review BCPs in conjunction with risk registers and vice versa.5 regulation 216 s.2(1)(a)7 regulation 198 s.2(1)(e)
Generic and specific plans6.17. As with emergency plans, the Regulations provide that Category 1 responders may use generic plans, specific plans, or a combination of the two in business continuity planning. A generic plan is a core plan which enables a Category 1 responder to respond to a wide range of possible impacts, setting out the common elements of the response to these (e.g. invocation procedure, command and control, access to financial resources).6.18. Specific plans may be required in relation to specific risks, sites or services. Specific plans provide a detailed set of arrangements designed to go beyond the generic arrangements when these are unlikely to prove sufficient.6.19. Specific plans will usually operate within the framework established by the generic plan. It is a matter for Category 1 responders themselves to decide - in the light of assessments of risk - what, if any, specific plans are required.Plan invocation6.20. The Regulations specifically require Category 1 responders to establish a procedure for determining when an emergency has occurred which affects its6.1. 
ability to continue to perform its functions.9
In other words, there must be a
clear procedure for invoking the plan. Where continuity of critical functions is threatened in the event of an emergency, there should be a clearly laid out escalation procedure. This should be identified, agreed and documented within the plan. The Regulations specifically require this procedure to:9 regulation 24
o identify the person who should determine whether such an emergency has occurred;o specify the procedure that person should adopt in taking that decision;o specify the persons who should be consulted before such a decision is taken; ando specify the persons who should be informed once a decision has been taken.Exercising BCPs6.21. Exercises provide demonstrable evidence of a business continuity and incident management competence and capability. A BCP cannot be considered reliable until it is exercised and has proved to be workable. As part of the BC process there is a continual need to prove plans and strategies by testing. No matter how well designed and thought-out a BCM strategy or BCP appears to be, a series of robust and realistic exercises will identify areas that require amendment.6.22. The Regulations require Category 1 responders to put in place arrangements for exercising BCPs in order to ensure that they are effective1.0 These arrangements should encompass the three principal purposes of exercising:o validating plans - to verify that the plan works;o rehearsing key staff - to familiarise key staff with what is expected of them in a crisis and preparing them for crisis conditions; ando testing systems - to ensure that systems relied upon to deliver resilience (e.g. uninterrupted power supply) function correctly and offer the degree of protection expected.10 regulation 25(a)
6.23. As a simple rule, if it has not been tested it does not work. Exercising must be maintained to hold credibility and encourage ownership across the organisation. Tests should build on the organisation’s past experience. The exercising programme should be flexible, and the focus and frequency of exercises should be responsive to:o the rate of change - where the pace of change (e.g. to the organisation or risk profile) is particularly rapid, exercises may need to be more frequent; ando outcomes of previous exercises - the identification of particular weaknesses and subsequent changes to plans may necessitate further exercising.Training key staff6.24. It is important to ensure that relevant people across the Category 1 responder- and in other organisations where appropriate - are confident and competent concerning the plan. It is particularly important that staff receive appropriate training prior to exercising. This will ensure that they are adequately prepared for what can be a challenging experience.6.25. The Regulations require Category 1 responders to put in place a training programme for those directly involved in the execution of the BCP should it be invoked.11 This should be reflected in plans. This should cover:o the contents of the plan - how is the plan invoked? What arethe key decision-making processes? Who else needs to be involved?11 regulation 25(b)
o their role in implementing the plan - what is expected of them? How do they fit into the wider picture?o key skills and knowledge required in crisis response.Reviewing and maintaining BCPs6.26. The Act specifically requires Category 1 responders to maintain business continuity plans to ensure that they can continue to deliver key services in the event of an emergency.12 This means that Category 1 responders must not only put plans in place, but ensure that they are reviewed and kept up to date.6.27. Category 1 responders exist in a dynamic environment - organisations themselves and the environment they operate in are subject to change. BCPs need to be reviewed and updated to ensure that they remain valid. The following aspects of plans should be reviewed:o personnel - staff turnover means that contact details will need constant updating;o the responsibilities of the Category 1 responder - where a Category 1 responder takes on new functions or delivers new services, this should be reflected;o organisational structures - where responders have experienced restructuring this may need to be reflected in plans;o suppliers or contractors - ensuring that the details of suppliers and contractors are kept up to date;o risk assessments - the Act requires Category 1 respondersto review plans in the light of changes to risk assessments; 13 ando business objectives/processes.12 s.2(1)(c)13 s.2(1)(e)
6.28. The frequency of plan review will depend on the rate of change within the organisation and the environment it operates within. Plan maintenance should take place on an ongoing basis, but all business continuity plans should be comprehensively reviewed at appropriate intervals.Publication of BCPs6.29. Communication with customers or service users - who may need information about service continuity in the event of an emergency - is important to community resilience. Emergencies cause serious disruption to people’s lives and increase reliance on public sector bodies - provision of information about what they can and cannot expect from Category 1 responders in the event of an emergency, may help to minimise this disruption.6.30. The Act requires the publication of aspects of BCM plans in so far as this is necessary or desirable for the purposes of preventing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency or otherwise responding to the emergency.146.31. Category 1 responders need only publish information where there is a positive benefit in doing so. For example, a Category 1 responder need not publish internal management information which would be of little relevance or interest to the public. Furthermore, the Regulations prohibit the publication of sensitive information (e.g. commercially confidential information, personal data) where consent has not been received from the originator of the information, or where the public interest in disclosure fails to outweigh the interests of the organisation or individual concerned.14 s.2(1)(f)
Box 6.0: Further advice and informationHow the Act and Regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland6.32. The Act and the Regulations apply in Scotland to bodies outside devolved competence in the same way as they apply in England.6.33. The Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers make provision as to how Category 1 responders in Scotland that fall within devolved competence, should exercise their duty under the Act to maintain business continuity plans.Wales6.34. The Act and the Regulations apply in Wales in the same way as they apply in England.Northern Ireland6.35. The Act and the Regulations apply to Category 1 responders exercising functions in Northern Ireland in the same way as they apply in England, but see information in Chapter 12 in relation to the Police Service of Northern Ireland.6.1. 
6.36. This section provides practical guidance on taking forward a BCM programme within a Category 1 responder organisation. It describes the discipline of BCM and outlines a methodology for implementing it. Category 1 responders must have regard to this material and may find it useful in fulfilling their duties under the Act. While the Government considers this to be a sound approach, Category 1 responders may use other models to deliver statutory requirements where there are compelling reasons for doing so.6.37. The Government is keen to give Category 1 responders the flexibility to make the best use of the resources and expertise available to them. The Regulations permit Category 1 responders to enter into collaborative arrangements in order to fulfil the BCM duty1. 5 Category 1 responders may:o deliver the duty separately;o deliver the duty jointly (e.g. by forming a joint BCM unit or resource);o agree that one Category 1 responder will facilitate the delivery of a BCM programme on behalf of a number of other Category 1 responders; oro enter into collaborative arrangements in which one or more Category 1 responder gives assistance to others in fulfilling their BCM duties (e.g. managing the overarching programme, developing framework plans).15 regulations 8 and 9
6.38. However, BCM must be owned and driven within the organisation itself - and engage the expertise and resources of its staff - in order to be effective. While collaborative arrangements can be used to make use of BCM expertise or resources in other Category 1 responders, responsibility for the robustness of BCM arrangements must remain within the organisation.What is business continuity and business continuity management?6.39. Business continuity 16 is the strategic and tactical capability of the organisation to plan for and respond to incidents and business disruptions in order to continue business operations at an acceptable predefined level.6.40. Business continuity management provides the strategic framework for improving an organisation’s resilience to interruption. Its purpose is to facilitate the recovery of key business systems and processes within agreed time frames, while maintaining the delivery of the Category 1 responder’s identified critical functions. It assists organisations to anticipate, prepare for, prevent, respond to and recover from disruptions, whatever their source and whatever aspect of the business they affect.6.41. BCM is a holistic management process that identifies potential threats to an organisation and the impacts to business operations that those threats, if realised, might cause. It also provides a framework for building organisational resilience with the capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of its key stakeholders, reputation, brand and core business activities. Business continuity management involves managing the recovery or continuation of activities in the event of a disruption, and management of the overall programme through training, exercises and reviews, to ensure business continuity plans stay current and up-to-date.16 BS25999 definition of business continuity
6.42. BCM is valid across the public, private and voluntary sectors. It is about maintaining the essential business deliverables of an organisation in an emergency. The primary ‘business’ of private sector organisations is the generation of profit, a process that BCM seeks to protect. Category 1 responders provide services to the public, and it is equally important that these are protected and resilient.BCM methodology6.43. The British Standard for business continuity (BS25999) works on a six-stage process widely acknowledged as best practice. This model provides a generic framework that is applicable across the public, private and voluntary sectors. This standard, or its equivalent in the water industry, the Security and Emergency Measures Direction (SEMD), provide a good basis for BCM.6.44. Figure 6.1 illustrates this approach. The rest of the chapter describes this process, and supports Category 1 responders in using this framework to fulfil their duties under the Act.Figure 6.1: The business continuity management lifecycleBS 25999-1:2006 BRITISH STANDARD business continuity management Part 1: Code of Practice 1717 Permission to reproduce extracts from BS25999 is granted by BSI.

6.45. As Figure 6.1 shows, the six stages of the process are:o Stage 1: BCM programme management: Programme management is at the heart of the process. It requires the participation of senior management and establishes the organisation’s approach to business continuity.o Stage 2: Understanding the organisation: This element assists in the understanding of the organisation through the identification of its key products and services and the critical activities and resources that support them. This element ensures that the BCM programme is aligned to the organisation’s objectives, obligations andstatutory duties.o Stage 3: Determining business continuity strategy: This element allows the organisation to select its strategies in order to meet its objectives.o Stage 4: Developing and implementing a BCM response: This stage looks at the need for Category 1 responders to develop and implement plans and arrangements to ensure continuity of critical activities,and the management of an incident.o Stage 5: Exercising, maintaining and reviewing BCM arrangements: An organisation’s arrangements cannot be considered reliable until exercised. This element ensures that an organisation’s BCM arrangements are validated by exercise and review and thatthey are kept up-to-date.o Stage 6: Embedding BCM in the organisation’s culture: Business continuity must become part of the way an organisation is managed to be effective. This stage provides the overarching element that ensures that opportunities are used at the various stages of the BCM process.o 
Delivering BCM arrangementsStage 1: BCM programme management6.46. In order to be successful, BCM must be regarded as an integral part of a Category 1 responder’s normal management processes.6.47. Achieving top-level buy-in is vital to developing robust BCM arrangements.Engaging senior officers is crucial to the success of any major programme because of the influence they have over resource allocation and the culture of an organisation. However, the commitment of the top level is particularly important in relation to BCM because:o it requires the leverage they exert across the organisation in order to be effective;o it requires decisions about attitudes to risk and service prioritisation that can only be taken at the top level; ando the top team is responsible for ensuring that effective governance arrangements are in place.Leadership6.48. Experience has shown that there is merit in giving a member of the executive management board overall responsibility for the BCM process by being appointed as the champion within the organisation. This will ensure that the profile of BCM issues is increased and decisions are made at the appropriate level.6.1. 
6.49. BCM is an ongoing process and it is important to gain the support and endorsement of the board at the end of each stage of the cycle. Critically, it should be the responsibility of senior management to provide the assurance that BCM arrangements are robust and meet the requirements of the Act.BCM co-ordinator6.50. Governance is about accountability, responsibility and control. A person with the appropriate seniority and authority should be identified as accountable for BCM policy, implementation and operation.6.51. Implementation planning should include arranging appropriate training for staff and exercising the capability; this stage is best carried out using a project management method to ensure that the implementation is effectively managed.6.52. Ongoing management of your BCM arrangements will contribute to business continuity becoming embedded within the organisation. Regular review, exercise and updating plans will ensure this happens. A review must take place of arrangements after change in the organisation; such as operating procedures, environment personnel, technology, and after an incident or exercise. If the change is significant to the organisation then a review of the Business Impact Analysis is also advised.Stage 2: Understanding the organisation6.53. An accurate assessment of the Category 1 responder’s organisation and its business is critical, as it will provide the basis upon which all subsequent BCM policies and processes are based.6.1. 
6.54. An understanding of the organisation comes from:o the organisation’s objectives, obligations, statutory duties and operating environment;o the activities, assets and resources that support the delivery of key products and services;o assessing the impact and consequences of failure of these activities; ando identifying and evaluating the threats that could disrupt these.6.55. Category 1 responders should carry out a business impact analysis that assesses over time the impacts if the activity was disrupted; and establish the maximum tolerable period of disruption (MTPD) of each. MTPDs can be worked out by looking at the:o time period after disruption that the activity must be resumed;o minimum level needed upon resumption; ando time period for achieving normal levels of operation.Key to  this  is  identifying  interdependencies  (assets,  infrastructure,  and resources) to be maintained.6.56. Category 1 responders should consider the following when assessing impacts:o the impact on staff or public wellbeing;o the impact of damage to, or loss of, premises, technology or information;o the impact of breaches of statutory duties or regulatory requirements;o 
o reputation damage;o damage to financial viability;o deterioration of product or service quality; environmental damage; ando external services and suppliers.Category 1 responders should document this process (approach, findings and conclusions).6.57. Identification of critical activities is essential to prioritise the areas that need to be focused on. In basic terms, an organisation’s critical activities are those that would have the greatest impact in the shortest time.6.58. Risk assessment is vital in evaluating threats, and risk should be understood in respect of the organisation’s critical activities. By utilising recognised risk techniques, a scoring can be achieved. Guidance on conducting risk assessments can be found in Chapter 4 of this guidance. Annex 4F sets out a risk matrix that can be used to score impacts.6.59. Having identified those areas where the Category 1 responder is most at risk, a decision has to be made as to what approach is to be taken to protect the operation.  This decision along with a documented list of key products and services, the business impact analysis and the risk assessment should be signed off by top management to ensure that the work is a true reflection of the organisation.6.1. 
6.60. As Annex 4F explains, the nature of the risk - defined in terms of its likelihood and impact - will determine which business continuity strategy is appropriate and what, if any, action is required. At one end of the spectrum, disruptions that are low likelihood and low impact may require no specific action, and may merely be dealt with through generic arrangements. Risks that are high impact and high probability, on the other hand, may point to the development of specific plans and risk mitigation strategies.6.61. A number of the strategies that could be adopted are given below:o do nothing - in some instances top-level management may consider the risk to be acceptable;o change, transfer or end the process - such decisions to alter business process must be taken with regard to the organisation’s key objectives and statutory responsibilities;o insure - may provide some financial recompense or support but will not aid the organisation’s response and will not meet all losses(e.g. reputation and other non-financial impacts, human consequences);o mitigate loss - tangible procedures to eliminate or reduce risk within the business; ando plan for business continuity - an approach that seeks to improve the Category 1 and 2 responders’ resilience to interruption, allowing for the recovery of key business and systems processes within therecovery time frame objective, while maintaining their critical functions.
6.62. Any strategy must recognise the internal and external dependencies of the organisation and must have general acceptance by the management functions involved. The continuity strategies adopted here will shape the ability of a Category 1 responder to perform its critical functions in the event of an emergency, and it is important that these decisions are taken by the appropriate officers in the full light of the facts.6.63. The Act requires Category 1 responders to assess the risk of emergencies occurring (“emergency risk assessment”) and use these assessments to inform emergency6.1. 
planning and business continuity planning (see Chapter 4).18
The development
of community risk registers will mean that Category 1 responders have access to up-to-date information about risks in their area. Contingencies that seriously disrupt the activities of the community may also limit the ability to respond to them effectively.Stage 3: Determining business continuity strategy6.64. Category 1 responders should look at strategic options for its critical activities, while bearing in mind the most appropriate strategy will depend on factors such as: the maximum tolerable period of disruption, cost, and consequences of inaction.6.65. Strategies should be considered for the following areas:

Senior managers should sign off documented strategies.Stage 4: Developing and implementing a BCM response6.67. Business continuity planning is at the heart of the BCM process. The business continuity plans provide the framework in which the Category 1 responder mobilises its response to a BCM challenge in the event of an emergency. Plans normally consist of an Incident Management Plan, a Business Continuity Plan and a Business Recovery Plan.6.68. In developing all plans, consideration should be given to:o keeping it short, simple and user-friendly - it will need to beread and understood in challenging and pressured circumstances;o ensuring the assumptions contained are realistic – e.g. numbers of staff directly affected by the incident, the effect of the ‘backlog trap’ (i.e. the impact of the accumulation of tasks left uncompletedon recovery);
o references to other sources of information and supporting documentation – e.g. guidance, databases, lists of key contacts, resources and suppliers;o action plans and checklists – what should be providedo ownership of key tasks - these should be reflected in job descriptions;o pro-formas - giving templates and model documentation;o version control - the need to implement document management procedures, including a list of all plan holders, which has to be maintained, together with a distribution and change control process; ando communications - effective communication with stakeholdersand, where appropriate, the media is crucial to an effective response6.69. The structure, content and detail of the BCPs will depend on the nature of the Category 1 responder, the risk and the environment in which it operates. In particularly large or complex organisations, it may be necessary to have departmental plans which integrate into one high-level plan. Further advice on plan presentation can be found in Chapter 5.6.70. The method by which an incident management, business continuity or business recovery plan is invoked should be clearly documented. As part of this, the individual(s) that have the authority to invoke them should be recorded along with: how to mobilise the team(s); rendezvous points; and command centre locations.6.71. Each incident management plan, business continuity plan and business recovery plan should set out prioritised objectives in terms of: the critical activities to be recovered; the timescales in which they are to be recovered; and the recovery levels for each critical activity.6.1. 
6.72. The purpose of a business continuity plan is to enable an organisation to recover or maintain its activities in the event of disruption. Invocation supports the critical activities of an organisation; plans may be invoked in whole or part and at any stage.6.73. An Incident Management Plan is a clearly defined and documented plan-of- action for use at the time of an incident. It should typically cover: task and action lists; emergency contacts; people activities; media response; stakeholder management; and locations. Other useful information to consider: contacts; mobilisation details for relevant agencies; log templates; maps, charts, plans and photographs.6.74. A Business Continuity Plan will typically contain: action plans and task lists, for example: how the BCP is invoked, who is responsible, the procedure, who does what when and where, services available, communications; resource requirements, for example: people, premises, technology, information and supplies; responsible person(s) and; forms, templates and annexes.6.75. A Business Recovery Plan aims to support the recovery and resumption of operations to a “normal” state. However, with some incidents it may not be possible to define what “normal” looks like until some time after an incident. Category 1 responders might, therefore, wish to ensure that BCPs are capable of extended operation, giving time for the development of recovery plans.6.76. The below diagram provides an illustration of how these three sorts of plan will come into play during a disruption.6.1.

to exercise BCPs to ensure they are effective.20
An organisation’s business
continuity and incident management arrangements cannot be considered reliable until exercised. Exercising is essential to developing teamwork, competence, confidence and knowledge, which is vital at the time of an incident. Arrangements should be verified through exercising, and a process of audit and self-assessment, to ensure that they are fit for purpose.6.78. When developing a BCM exercise programme, Category 1 responders will need to consider the:o focus of the programme;o types of exercise to be used19 Permission to reproduce extracts from [Name of Standard] is granted by BSI.

o involvement of senior management in developing, executing and quality-assuring the programme;o process for delivering exercises; ando relationship between the BCM exercise programme and the exercising of emergency plans.6.79. Exercises should focus on impacts and test capabilities. While there is an infinite number of scenarios and possible responses, the list of impacts and capabilities is limited.Figure 6.3: Types and Methods of Exercising BCM Strategies 21ComplexityExerciseProcessVariantsGood PracticeFrequency ?SimpleDesk checkReview/ amendment of content Challenge content of BCPUpdate/validation Audit/verificationAt least annually AnnuallyMediumWalk- through of planSimulationExercise critical activitiesChallenge content of BCPUse ‘artificial’ situation to validate that the BCP(s) contain both necessary and sufficient information to enable a successful recoveryInvocation in a controlledsituation that does not jeopardise business as usual operationInclude interaction and validateparticipants’ rolesIncorporate associated plansDefined operations from alternative site for afixed timeAnnuallyAnnually or twice yearlyAnnually or less21 Regulation 4(4)(b), 4(7)
ComplexityExerciseProcessVariantsGood PracticeFrequencyComplexExercise full BCP including incidentmanagementBuilding-/ campus-/ exclusion zone- wide exerciseAnnually or lessThe frequency of exercises should depend upon both the organisation’s needs, the environment in which it operates, and stakeholder requirements. However, the exercising programme should be flexible, taking into account the rate of change within the organisation and the outcome of previous exercises. The above exercise methods can be employed for individual plan components, and single andmultiple plans.6.80. Exercising can take various forms, from a test of the communications plan, a desk- top walk-through, to a live exercise (See Figure 6.3 above). In all cases though, exercises should be realistic, carefully planned, and agreed with stakeholders, so that there is a minimum risk of disruption to business processes.6.81. The exercise programme should have the full support of the executive lead for business continuity issues. But the involvement of senior management should not be limited to defining the structure of the programme. In addition to taking part in exercises, senior management should be involved in quality-assuring the exercise programme and endorsing the outcomes.6.1. 
6.82. Figure 6.4 suggests a process for carrying out an exercise programme. Exercising is not about ‘passing’ or ‘failing’, it is all about learning lessons. There should be a debrief after each exercise in order to capture the experience of all the participants. What is important is that the captured data is recorded and considered as part of the post-exercise analysis.Figure 6.4: Exercising your BCP – the learning cycle6.83. Every exercise should have clearly defined aims and objectives. A post-exercise debriefing and analysis should be undertaken which considers the achievement against these.6.84. The post-exercise analysis is usually undertaken individually by the exercise manager or as a meeting of the exercise-planning group. A post-exercise report should be produced that contains recommendations and a timetable for implementation.6.1. 
6.85. This report must be submitted to the executive lead for business continuity within the Category 1 responder organisation for approval of the recommendations.6.86. Once approval has been obtained, the changes to the BCP can be implemented. This should drive changes to the BCM and will be tested as part of any future exercising programme by the business continuity managers. This process provides the audit trail of BCP maintenance and testing.6.87. When exercising a specific part of a plan it may be more appropriate for the output to be a simple memorandum detailing the part tested. For example, for a call-out cascade exercise that tests the contacts listed within the plan for activation, a memo to the organisation’s executive lead for business continuity that the test took place, was completed satisfactorily, and that all the contacts listed in the BCP are correct, would be sufficient to create the audit trail of that aspect of plan testing.6.88. It is important that business continuity planning and exercising are not done in isolation from wider emergency planning work. In part, BCPs are in place to ensure that Category 1 responders are able to deliver their emergency response function in the event of an emergency. Category 1 responders should not forget the close synergies between emergency plans and BCPs when learning the lessons of exercises and making changes as a result. Post exercise reports may have implications for both.6.89. The purpose of this exercise programme is to test the robustness of BCPs in the event of an emergency - will it enable the Category 1 responder to cope effectively with disruptions to the provision of critical services? One such critical function must be the emergency response function itself.6.1. 
6.90. The Act specifically requires Category 1 responders to maintain BCM plans to ensure that they can continue to deliver key services in the event of an emergency. It is essential that Category 1 responders must not only put plans in place, but also ensure that they are regularly reviewed and kept up-to-date.6.91. Plan maintenance should therefore be an ongoing process. It is good practice to undertake a comprehensive review of the state of the plan periodically.6.92. A process should be established whereby the BCM team is informed of relevant changes and developments, and that these are incorporated into the plan. Effective version control procedures should be implemented to ensure that relevant members of staff are working from the correct edition of the plan.Stage 6: Embedding BCM in the organisation’s culture6.93. Documenting the BCP is one element of developing a BCM strategy. Its success, however, depends upon:o implementation of the recommendations made, across the entire organisation;o a programme of training for those directly involved in the execution of the plan; ando an education and awareness programme to ensure understanding and adoption of the plan in relevant parts of the organisation - this applies to both internal and external stakeholders (e.g. employeesand suppliers).
6.94. Category 1 responders should deliver a programme of training and awareness to ensure that the relevant parts of the organisation are confident and competent concerning the plan. All parties must appreciate the importance of BCM to the operation’s survival and their role in this process. This means that business continuity should be ‘mainstreamed’ in emergency management and should be a core element of the emergency planning culture the Act establishes.6.95. As the first part of this chapter notes, the Regulations require Category 1 responders to give appropriate training to those involved in implementing BCPs.23 This section of the chapter also sets out the objectives of such training programmes and what they should cover.6.96. Training will need to be done on a rolling basis to cover staff turnover. BCM co-ordinators should establish a training database to monitor the take-up of training opportunities.6.97. It is also important to ensure that awareness of BCM issues is raised throughout the organisation, to ensure that all relevant staff have confidence in its ability to manage in a crisis, and know how they should respond in the event of a disruption. For example, some organisations distribute ‘z-cards’ to all staff, setting out what they should do in the event of a range of contingencies (e.g. details of secondary sites or evacuation points). The box overleaf sets out some of the key messages and the means of getting them across.23 regulation 25(b)
Box 6.1: The Business Case for BCMPart of embedding a ‘continuity culture’ within an organisation is to convince senior staff of the business case for BCM. It makes sense to put in place BCM arrangements because they help to:o protect the reputation of the Category 1 responder. The community expects continuity of critical services, even inthe most challenging of circumstances. They expect you to be fully in control, and to be seen to be in control - your organisation’s reputation is at risk if you are not.Maintaining the reputation of statutory services in an emergency is a vital element for public reassurance;o produce clear cost benefits. Identifying, preventing and managing disruptions in advance can reduce the costs to an organisation in terms of financial expenditure and management time. The demands of the insurance market have also increasingly become an important driver;o protect the organisation, ensuring that Category 1 responders can help others in an emergency. For Category 1 responders to help others, they first have to be able to keep themselves going in the face of a disruption. BCM will help ensure that they can mobilise the capabilities they need to deal with the emergency. It will also help ensure that the impact of the emergency on the day-to-day functions of the Category 1 responder is kept to a minimum, and that disruptions to vital services do notdeepen the impact of the emergency on the wider community;
6.98. To be truly effective, BC must form part of the culture in an organisation. This can be achieved by: leadership from senior personnel; assigning clear responsibilities; awareness raising; skills training; and exercising plans.6.99. Category 1 responders should extend their awareness-raising activities to those third parties upon whom the Category 1 responder depends in both normal and crisis operations. They need to be aware of how the response will develop when a BCM event occurs, and what this will mean for them.6.100. Category 1 responders also have an interest in ensuring that their suppliers and contractors have in place robust BCM arrangements. To ensure the resilience of operations, it is necessary to ensure that other aspects of the delivery chain are resilient too. It is important to build BCM into procurement and contract management processes. The Office of Government Commerce provides detailed advice on these issues which is freely available on its website: http://www.ogc.gov.uk.6.1. 
6.101. Business continuity as part of Civil Protection is very much a multi-agency activity, where Category 1 responders must work together - and understand each other’s capabilities and vulnerabilities - if they are going to be effective.6.102. In the emergency planning area, it is essential for Category 1 responders to be aware of each other’s plans. BCM arrangements underpin emergency management capabilities - it is important that Category 1 responders have an awareness of the continuity issues facing their partners in the event of an emergency. Which functions will be discontinued? How will functions be scaled down or up in the event of an emergency? Where are partners’ contingency sites?6.103. The Local Resilience Forum (LRF) provides a framework for dialogue about business continuity issues. Category 1 responders should consider using the LRF process as a means of raising mutual awareness, ensuring that plans dovetail, developing frameworks for mutual assistance, and sharing best practice.6.104. The Act requires Category 1 responders to publish aspects of their BCPs in so far as this is necessary or desirable for the purposes of dealing with emergencies.246.105. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that Category 1 responders make relevant information available to the public about what will happen in the event of an emergency. There are three principal classes of information which Category 1 responders should consider communicating to the public:o a descriptive account of the business continuity plans they have in place for the purposes of reassuring the public;24 s.2(1)(f)
o information about the implications of emergencies for the continuity of a Category 1 responder’s ordinary operations – e.g. possibility of service suspensions or adjustments. Proactively publishing this sort of information in advance of an emergency allows the public to think about their preparations. For example, parents might find it useful to know under which circumstances schools might be closed in the event of severe weather;o sources of information and advice about service continuity issues that the public could consult in the event of an emergency.6.106. This communication can take place through a variety of means, including websites and other publications. This could also be achieved by integrating business continuity issues within mission statements, statements of service and other public information brochures, relating either to the organisation as a whole or to individual services.6.107. Responders can get further guidance and support from the following website http:// shop.bsigroup.com/. In particular, the British Standard on business continuity, BS25999 parts 1 and 2, will be useful along with PB25666: Guidance on exercising and testing for continuity and contingency programmes.6.108. The International Standards Organisation (ISO) are in the process of producing a requirements and guidance document on business continuity; ISO22301 and ISO22313. Publication of these two documents has not been agreed. Early indication is however that if published, there will be nothing substantially different to the British Standard BS 25999, parts 1 and 2. Therefore, alignment with the British Standard will not only provide a good basis for BCM but at this stage would also appear to align with the forthcoming international standards.6.1.

The scale and nature of any emergency will dictate the level of national involvement in the handling of it, particularly on the communications side. If ministerial involvement becomes necessary, then the News Co-ordination Centre (NCC) will be set up in Whitehall by information staff within Cabinet Office. The NCC will function alongside the government department leading the response1 and liaise closely with staff from the Central Office of Information News and Public Relations 2 at the scene of the emergency, if outside London.The NCC will help to co-ordinate the information activities of the various government departments and agencies involved, by pulling together briefing from the different expert bodies for ministers and ensuring that interview bids for ministers are handled appropriately. They will work closely with the national and international media and monitor the output of major broadcasters, in order to correct inaccuracies and spot subject areas where additional material would provide better balance in coverage. It can be up and running within 90 minutes and can operate 24 hours a day as required.The NCC will have responsibility both for meeting the needs of the news agenda and managing the delivery of public information and safety advice at a national level. It will be manned by staff from the various affected departments, to ensure effective co-ordination of activities. Where necessary, it may invoke standing protocols with the media to issue Public Safety Information either nationwide or in particular regions.

Robust communications links will be established with those at the scene and in charge of operations to make sure that strategic and high-level political decisions are based on accurate, up-to-date information. The NCC, or the Assembly Press Office in Wales, may send someone from the team to the site of the incident as a contact point, who can keep those on site in touch with central, political activities and interests.The NCC will not be directly involved in operational decisions on site about media arrangements. However, the central operations team that manages the NCC has, in close co-operation with central government, the devolved administrations, local government, emergency services, utilities and other operators, produced detailed protocols. These cover many logistical aspects of dealing with the sort of massive influx of media organisations into an area which would be generated by a national-level catastrophe.

The range of emergencies listed in the first column of the table at the end of this annex, matches the main classification of emergencies in Annex 4B of chapter 4: Local responder risk assessment duty. The remaining columns deal with the following:Suggestions as to the Category 1 responders likely to have a duty to maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public in relation to particular emergencies.Suggestions as to which of those Category 1 responders should take the lead on behalf of the Category 1 responders in maintaining arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public in the initial stages of an emergency. Responsibility may of course transfer from one Category 1 responder to another as the emergency situation develops.Category 1 responders must of course make their own decisions about identifying which will take the role of lead responder in the light of local conditions. They may wish to make a more detailed breakdown of responsibilities, as suggested by the detailed classification of types of hazard in Annex 4B.It is important to recognise that the lead Category 1 responder will not necessarily take the lead overall in warning, informing and advising the public. This role may in certain circumstances fall to a Category 2 responder or an organisation which is not a responder. This is dealt with in column 3 of table 7B. Column 2 suggests which Category 1 responder might be the most appropriate to take the lead on behalf of Category 1 responders within these overall arrangements.

Suggestions of non-Category 1 responders who, in particular circumstances, may play the lead role, or a significant role, in arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public.The Act imposes a duty to maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public on Category 1 responders only. In practice, Category 2 responders and the Met Office, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), or the Food Standards Agency (FSA) will have a significant role in these arrangements in relation to particular emergencies. In some cases, it will even be appropriate for a Category 2 responder or the Met Office, Defra and the FSA to take the lead role. Included in column 3 of table 7B are organisations which are relevant in this way.The Regulations provide that Category 1 responders must have regard to the arrangements maintained by these bodies in performing their duty under the Act. The Regulations also provide that Category 1 responders need not unnecessarily duplicate the arrangements maintained by these bodies.Suggestions of other organisations which will have an important role in arrangements to warn, advise and inform the public and with whom Category 1 responders may wish to liaise.In addition to Category 2 responders and the Met Office, Defra, and the FSA, there are other organisations which will play an important role in communicating with the public. These bodies are unlikely to play such a significant role that it is appropriate for Category 1 responders to be required to have regard to their activities under the Regulations. Nonetheless, there will often be merit in Category 1 responders considering the role that these bodies will play in communicating with the public in an emergency and in liaising with them in the planning phase.

Annex 7 D: Duty to communicate with the public – The Ten Step CycleRevision to Emergency Preparedness
The Ten Step Cycle – Guidance NoteThe following Ten Step Cycle has been designed to assist Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) in implementing the Communicating with the Public duty, as laid down in the Civil Contingencies Act (2004).The CCA states that Category 1 responders should:o maintain arrangements to warn, and provide information and advice to, the public if an emergency is likely to occur or has occurred;o put in place arrangements to make information available to the public about civil protection matters.The Ten Step Cycle can be used by LRFs in a number of ways. The following are examples:i) LRFs can work through the Ten Step Cycle step-by-step, in the same way LRFs approach the Risk Assessment duty.ii) put LRFs can choose to use the Ten Step Cycle, alongside the Expectations and Indicators of Good Practice for Category 1 and 2 responders, as a guide and barometer, dipping in and out at various steps as required.Ultimately, LRFs will reach the final step, and will have taken a big stride towards implementing a full set of warning and informing arrangements, which are fit for purpose and in line with the risks, set out in their Community Risk Register (CRR). This process will help local communities better understand the risks they face, and the actions they need to take in the event of an emergency. At that stage, as in all aspects of emergency planning, LRFs will find themselves back at
the beginning, and following a review of the work carried out previously, will be ready to start the Ten Step Cycle once more.The Ten Step Cycle for Communicating with the PublicStep 1a) Establish a Public Warning Task Group as a subgroup of the LRF General Working Group.The LRF will need to set up a multi-agency task group to take this work forward, ensuring that it has a representative from all Category 1 responders - the duty applies to all of them. The LRF should consider inviting emergency planning officers, communications professionals, members of local and regional media, as well as appropriate Category 2 responders. Not only will this enhance partnership working and governance, but will allow the LRF to explore all possible solutions in making recommendations on possible control measures in this area.b) Establish an audit process – rationale for decisions madeThis is obviously important with any emergency planning process but the LRF should establish an auditing process to log all decisions that are taken, and processes followed throughout this cycle. This will help the LRF to review progress, answer Freedom of Information (FOI) enquiries and any other queries received, as well as helping to support any post-incident reviews.
Step 2Use the Community Risk Register as the task group’s starting point:o What is the Emergency Risk Management Context for the LRF area? Is the LRF area urban or rural in nature? Consider the geographical profile of the landscape in the LRF area. What hazards do the LRF need to manage – are there main rivers prone to slow-onset riverine flooding, for example, or streams that are prone to flash flooding?What is the infrastructure like – motorways or B-roads? Do the LRF have large international communities where English may not be the first language? Asking such questions about the Emergency Risk Management Context will enable the LRF to set the background against which the task group will work, and allow the LRF to identify the most appropriate control measures for the area, the hazards, and the public.o What are the timescales and impact for each risk?Assess the warning and informing timescales for each hazard, using the outcome descriptions from the CRR as a guide – what are the warning periods for each, or does the hazard have no-notice characteristics?Identifying these factors will also assist the task group to identify the most appropriate control measures against each hazard.
o What are the priorities identified within the CRR?The task group should familiarise itself with those hazards which require the most urgent risk treatment to be carried out on them in relation to warning and informing control measures. This will obviously have a bearing on any future recommendations to the LRF regarding proposed control measures.Step 3Identify and agree the lead responders for each risk in the Community Risk Registero Purpose of appointing lead respondersWhy do LRFs need to identify lead responders? Firstly, the Civil Contingencies Act (2004) states that LRFs are required to identify those Category 1 responders who will take the lead in maintaining arrangements to warn and inform and educate the public, and educate the public about risks and other civil protection matters, for eachrisk identified in the LRF Community Risk Register (CRR).However, in communicating with the public, there is a need to avoid causing confusion during an incident, and in the absence of a lead responder, every Category 1 responder would be obliged to issue warnings, thereby increasing the potential for confusion. Identifying lead responders also helps to avoid duplication of effort – there is no sense in all agencies using valuable resources to issue the same warning and / or information.
In short, selecting lead responders to maintain arrangements for warning and informing the public helps the LRF to ensure that the public receives consistent and agreed safety information from a lead source only. This can play a significant role in mitigating the impact of an emergency on a community.o Regulations require Category 1 responders to have in place a mechanism for selecting lead responders either (a) in advance, or (b) at the timeof an incident.The ideal scenario is that the LRF will select lead responders in advance (i.e. before an emergency occurs). This will not only save the multi-agency tactical command valuable time during a major incident, but will also smooth the path to full implementation of the duty as a whole. Agreeing lead responders in advance for each risk in the CRR will enable the LRF to put in place a minimum number of warning protocols, thus keeping the process as simple as possible. Crisis management can be challenging enough without having to go through the process of choosing a lead responder at the same time.However, if the LRF cannot agree on lead responders in advance, or indeed would prefer to leave it until the response phase of an incident, mechanisms must be put in place to allow that decision-making process to take place effectively when it is required.o Regulations permit Category 1 responders to have a mechanism for changing the lead as the emergency evolves.o 
As an incident proceeds through the response phase to recovery and beyond, the lead responder for warning and informing may need to change, and the Civil Contingencies Act allows for mechanisms to be established enabling these changes to be made. For example, at the conclusion of the response to a flood incident, the police may pass management of the incident to the relevant local authority (as was the case during the Carlisle floods in 2005). This might also be the appropriate time to change the lead responder for warning and informing the public, in this case from the police to local authority.NOTE: It is important to note that the lead responder is not expected to carry out the maintenance of warning and informing arrangements in isolation. The communicating with the public duty falls to all Category 1 responders. The lead responder concept steers LRF partners to provide support, advice and guidance to those agencies designated as lead responders throughout all stages of the disaster cycle. Partnership working is critical to success in implementing this duty effectively by assessing procedures against the risks identified in your CRR. This will help to ensure that the right messages are issued to the right people at the right time and help to promote a co-ordinated approach to communicating with the public.Choosing the LRF’s lead respondersThe following steps provide LRFs with a simple process for selecting lead responders for warning and informing the public. Although this may seem a challenging task at first, it can actually be relatively straight forward if task groups follow the simple steps below:
o Call together a specific ‘Task & Finish’ session for the LRF Public Warning Task Group, ensuring that all Category 1 responders are present – over the course of the next couple of hours, the task is to assign a lead responder agency against each of the risks contained in the LRF’s CRR.o Ensure that copies of the CRR are available with an additional column added, so that task groups can insert the agreedlead responder for each incident phase as the process develops.o Now, with one task group member taking the lead, ‘walk through’ each risk scenario, analysing every phase of the disaster cycle, and deciding which agencies have a role as lead responder as the scenario / incident evolves. These agencies should then be inserted into the amended CRR table. The task group will also have to identify trigger points for the handover of the lead responsibility for warning, informing and advising from one responder body to another, andthe procedures to achieve this (see Annex 7C).However, the task group, where possible, should attempt to select one overall lead responder to take the lead against each risk, to ensure arrangements are maintained, and most importantly, to issue warnings during the immediate aftermath of an incident being declared (no-notice), or in the period prior to a potential incident (notice), to prevent imminent danger to life and property. This agency is the lead responder for both the planning, and immediate emergency response phase. As stated above, they should expect the full support of all Category 1 responders in undertaking this role.PAGE 8
The following scenarios are provided as examples – one notice type scenario (Flooding – major fluvial), and one no-notice (toxic release).Notice type scenario: Flooding – major fluvialo Outcome description (taken from CRR): Sustained period ofheavy rain for two weeks; rising river levels over all regions; thousands of properties affected for 7 to 21 days; some risk to life; impact on roads and rail infrastructure.o Pre-flood: right up to the point where the water is about to breachthe river banks, the Environment Agency (EA) will have issued a series of warnings to the public and other key stakeholders (i.e. Flood Watch, Flood Warning, and Severe Flood Warning). Therefore, the EA as the lead responder at this stage is the agency best placed to issue an alert in the run-up to the incident.o Flood response: once the multi-agency response is activated, and the emphasis changes to consequence management, the Police willcoordinate all public safety messages, to ensure that a common message is being transmitted. In addition, all other Category 1 responders will be communicating with stakeholders that are specific to their own individual organisations (e.g. local authorities will communicate with their internal services, the voluntary agencies, schools, residential care homes, and elected members). Once the flood situation has receded, the EA will then issue an ‘All Clear’ message. At this stage, as the incident enters the recovery phase, the lead responder role will probably change from police to local authority.
o Outcome? In this example there are three major changes in lead responder for this scenario: Environment Agency – police – local authority. However, from a preparedness perspective, the task group may wish to select one agency to take the lead. Its role would be to lead on the preparations for (a) maintaining arrangements to warn and inform, and (b) to educate the public about risk. However, as indicated above all other Category 1 responders would have a duty to assist that lead agency in completing these tasks.No-notice type scenario: Toxic releaseo Outcome description (taken from CRR): Toxic chemical release, up to 3 km from site, resulting in a number of fatalities and casualties.o Pre-incident and response: There are three types of scenario considered here: the first is where the site is known, and is operated by a company governed by the COMAH, REPPIR, or PSR Regulations. The second involves a site that is not known, and is not governed by the aforementioned Regulations.1And finally, the third is a ‘mobile incident’ – in other words, a tanker, ship, and rail carriage – an incident thatcan occur anywhere and at any time.Consider scenario 1. The site operator/ pipeline owner has a duty under COMAH/ REPPIR/ PSR to provide safety information to the public working in, living in, or passing through its Public Information Zone (PIZ). This frequently takes the form of calendars and/ or letters. The site operator / pipeline owner also has a duty under the above legislation to warn the public of a major accident when they occur. However, the task group still needs to designate a lead responder(s) to ensure that warning and informing arrangements are maintained – this might involve site visits, assessment of existing warning infrastructure, and provision1 Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations (2001) (REPPIR); Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (1999) (COMAH);
Pipelines Safety Regulations (1996) (PSR).
PAGE 10
of safety information outside of the PIZ. Again, the task group should walk- through the scenario – in the pre-incident phase, all Category 1 responders could theoretically take a lead role.As an example, Cheshire LRF has agreed that the police will be the lead responder agency for several scenarios involving COMAH, REPPIR, and Major Accident Hazard Pipelines. In that case, the task group agreed that the police would be the lead responder for warning and informing during the response phase, as local arrangements require that agencies coordinate all safety messages issued to the public for these types of incident (whether supplementary to the operator’s initial warning, an initial warning as a result of an operator’s failure to warn, and / or subsequent safety action information, such as ‘Go In, Stay In, Tune In’. In the recovery phase, the lead responder changes to the local authorities, with key input from healthcare agencies.o Outcomes? In this example, there are two major changes in lead responder for this scenario: police – local authority / health agencies. Again, from a preparedness perspective, the task group may wish to select one agency to take the lead. Its role would be to lead on the preparations for (a) maintaining arrangements to warn and inform, and (b) educating the public about risk. And as indicated above, all the other Category 1 responders would have a duty to assist that lead agency in completing these tasks.It is likely that, as the task group assesses through each hazard sub-category, they will find that a natural rhythm develops within the task group, with patterns emerging as they proceed. The key factor to remember is that this is very much a partnership exercise with support flowing from all partners involved in managing communications in an emergency. Even if a particular Category 1
responder is assigned more lead responder tasks than another, it should expect to receive the full support and cooperation of all other responders.The selected lead responders need to be recorded on the LRF’s adapted Community Risk Register.Step 4Carry out a gap analysis:o What systems and arrangements are already in place in the LRF area?o What level of capability is in place already and what are the limitations?o Where are the gaps in local capability?To develop effective plans and deliver suitable warning and informing arrangements, it is important to assess the existing capabilities and limitations for communicating with the public against the risks that have been identified in the LRF area. By carrying out this analysis the LRF will be able to establish a baseline set of existing control measures to compare against the risks identified in the CRR which can then be built upon further into this cycle.After mapping out existing capability, the task group should make a considered judgement as to the gaps in the control measures for warning and informing the public against the risks identified in the CRR – this will be re-assessed following Step 5.
Step 5o Identify the target audiences for each risk in the CRR. Where are they located?o Identify vulnerable groups. Has the gap analysis changed as a result?At this stage the task group should have completed the following:o Consideration and agreement of emergency management risk context;o Selection of Lead Responders against all risks identified in the CRR; ando A gap analysis of all existing and proposed warning, informing, and education arrangements in the LRF area.So, what’s next? The LRF will now need to identify the target audiences against each risk in the CRR. Who are they? Where are they? Will the chosen method of communication change depending on the time of day or night? What safety action do they need to take for each risk, according to the risk characteristics and timescales outlined in Step 2?What about vulnerable groups and people in the LRF area? Are there any residential care homes or schools? Are there any members of the community with hearing or sight impairments? How will the LRF engage vulnerable people? These groups, and their warning and informing requirements, need to be addressed not only from a site specific perspective, but generically as well.The LRF now need to re-assess the gap analysis by adding the target audiences into the equation. How effective are the existing systems in the light of this re-assessment? Where are the gaps now against each risk in the CRR?
Step 6Consult the public in the LRF area, discuss the partnership’s work with neighbouring LRFs and seek out examples of good practice.The task group will now be approaching the stage where it will need to consider making recommendations to the LRF in order to fill the gaps in the warning, informing, and education arrangements to meet with both elements of the communicating with the public duty established in the Civil Contingencies Act (2004).However, before continuing, there are a few more actions that the LRF need to take:a) Consult the public in the LRF areaWhat do the communities want to see put in place? What problems have they faced in previous incidents? For example, could they hear the off-site sirens? Do they understand the meaning of various siren tones? How would they like to be kept informed? Consultation could be carried out through door-to-door or postal surveys, websites, and consultation with elected members, public meetings, or setting up a stall in the local supermarket or shopping centre.b) Talk to the neighbouring LRFs and other practitionersWhat arrangements do neighbouring LRFs have in place? Talk to each other, and come to an understanding about the best way forward for the whole community. There are obvious advantages to partnership working. Joined-up arrangements across administrative boundaries can enhance the resilience of control measures and can help to improve the effectiveness of what would otherwise be ‘stand-alone’ arrangements.
c) Seek out and take advantage of examples of good practiceThere are 42 LRFs in England and Wales, the key members of which are required to carry out this duty. As a result, there is already a range of good working practice in this area. Seek it out and let neighbouring LRFs know about the ideas that the task group has developed. Be prepared to be influenced also. As is often said in emergency planning circles, ‘don’t re-invent the wheel’ – if one sees a good idea working in another area, adopt it for the LRF, and pass it on.Step 7a) LRF to decide what is sufficient – set the standard.The Task Group is now at the stage where it needs to develop and agree recommendations to present to the LRF, on the basis of the work above. When doing so, consider the following factors:o Ensure that the LRF have consulted with all stakeholders, including other LRF task groups - be inclusive.o Put ‘address resilience issues’ in the task group’s recommendations: what resilience does the package of proposals have? For example, are the task group recommending any back-up systems should loss of power be experienced? Could the package be affected by staff shortages?o Is the recommended package multi-layered? It is very unlikely that one system will be sufficient to provide coverage for all ‘at-risk’ communities. Consider how the LRF would communicate with the public (i) at different times of the day (or night) and (ii) who are living and working in different locations. Take this into account when designing the solutions package. Remember to design adaptability into the package, so that it can be enhanced in the future, be that as a result of changes to Publico 
Information Zones around COMAH sites, or changes to a particular risk’s characteristics.o What are the risks that need the most urgent attention froma ‘communicating with the public’ duty perspective? This may influence the task group’s recommendations.o Give the LRF a number of options to consider, including the task group’s favoured package. Additionally, avoid recommending only a ‘deluxe’ option – be expansive, and provide a variety of solutions, with supporting business cases where necessary. All options should have community safety and resilience at the forefront.Present the task group’s recommendations to the LRF. The LRF will now need to decide which of the recommendations it is prepared to endorse, in line with the duties members have as Category 1 responders under the Civil Contingencies Act (2004). This will probably require resourcing (both financial and human), initiation of projects, and time.The LRF will need to decide what level of control measures it is willing to implement against the risks presented in the CRR. Throughout its deliberations, the LRF should focus on the legislative duties, and a duty to keep their communities safe.b) Implement LRF agreed control measuresDevise and initiate a work programme to implement those recommendations approved by LRF.
Step 8Implement a comprehensive training and exercising regime, to test the LRF’s warning and informing arrangements.When discussing this element as a task group, members need to ask the following questions?o How will the LRF ensure the warning and informing arrangements within multi-agency plans are effective?o How will the LRF test systems to ensure that they deliverwhat they are designed to deliver while at the same time avoiding alarming the public unnecessarily?o How will the LRF train and maintain the required skills of key staff?o What training needs exist?Step 9Ensure that all stakeholder communities are informed on a continuous basis through the design and implementation of a regularly updated education and awareness raising campaign.Recommendations for an enhanced public education programme need to be presented to the LRF in conjunction with the proposed package of warning and informing solutions. These recommendations should address not only the issues of required safety actions and details of how the public will be warned and informed, but should also inform them of the risks they face, and how they can help to mitigate, prepare for, and respond to those risks.
Recommendations should also provide a focus for annual, site, and subject specific risk awareness raising programmes.Note: The above awareness raising programmes should be started as early in the Ten Step Cycle as possible – task groups do not need to wait until reaching Step (9) to implement these types of initiatives.Step 10Measure the effectiveness of the implemented control measures, review, and adjust as appropriate.As with any emergency planning process, it is important that all arrangements are reviewed on an annual basis, (or in line with agreed CRR priorities), to assess and monitor their effectiveness. These reviews should include not only internal LRF assessments and technical analysis, but also community perspectives; are the arrangements working for them? Could they be improved? All results should help improve the arrangements for the future, and in doing so help keep the LRF’s communities safe and minimise the impact of emergencies.
 Chapter 7 Communicating with the PublicRevision to Emergency PreparednessCivil Contingencies Act Enhancement ProgrammeMarch 2012
Chapter 7 (Communicating with the Public) of Emergency Preparedness, Revised Versionï SummaryCategory 1 responders’ duties to communicate with the public under the Act are based on the belief that a well-informed public is better able to respond to an emergency and to minimise the impact of the emergency on the community (paragraphs 7.6).ï The Act includes public awareness and warning and informing as two distinct legal duties for Category 1 responders - advising the public of risks before an emergency and warning and keeping it informed in the event of an emergency (paragraphs 7.1).ï Arrangements for warning and informing the public complement emergency planning arrangements (paragraphs 7.26).ï Category 1 responders need both to plan their communications and to test their communications arrangements to ensure they are effective (paragraphs 7.28).ï In the same way that Category 1 responders must ensure that their emergency plans are appropriate for the scale and type of risks involved, communications arrangements should be appropriate for the message and the targeted audience (paragraphs 7.32).PAGE 2
 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE	7.1. There are two aspects of the duty in relation to communicating with the public.The first is that the public be made aware of the risks of emergencies and how Category 1 responders are prepared to deal with them if they occur. The second is that arrangements are made to warn the public and that the public be provided with information and advice as necessary if an emergency is likely to occur or has occurred.Arrange for the publication of assessments and plans7.2. The duties to assess risks and to prepare plans (covered in Chapter 4) are followed by a further duty on Category 1 responders to arrange for the publication of all or part of risk assessments and plans they have made, where publication is necessary or desirable to prevent, reduce, control, mitigate or take other action in connection with an emergency. 17.3. Arranging for publication means that the Category 1 responders do not necessarily have to publish these documents themselves but they must arrange for them to be published.7.4. The duty is not necessarily to arrange to publish the whole of a risk assessment or a complete plan but only those parts which it is necessary or desirable to publish where this will add value in raising public awareness and would assist in dealing with an emergency.7.5. Category 1 responders meet these requirements by publishing a Community Risk Register (CRR), which provides an agreed assessment of the risks affecting a local area and an agreed position on the planning and resourcing priorities required to prepare for those risks.7.1. 
1 s. 2(1)(f)
PAGE 3
7.6. The more information the public has access to, and the better educated they therefore become before an event, the more open they are likely to be to the warnings and advice they are given at the time of an emergency. A well informed public is better able to respond to an emergency and this will minimize the impact of an emergency on the community. Responses to a number of emergencies over recent years have highlighted the need to encourage individuals and communities (including businesses) to be better prepared and more self reliant during emergencies. This allows the authorities to focus on those areas and people in greatest need.7.7. The duty to make the public aware of the risks of emergencies does not extend to a requirement to assist individuals/organisations in developing community resilience or to promote community resilience. However, responders should recognise the benefits of engaging with the community and promoting individual and community resilience.Avoid alarming the public unnecessarily7.8. At the same time, when publishing assessments and plans, the Regulations require Category 1 responders to have regard to the need not to alarm the public unnecessarily. 27.9. There is a similar duty to avoid alarming the public unnecessarily when making arrangements to warn, inform and advise them.3Sensitive information7.10. Where risk assessments or plans contain sensitive information,4 then only edited or summary versions of all or part of the document should be published.

PAGE 4
Joint discharge of functions and other forms of collaborative working7.11. The duty to arrange for the publication of all or part of assessments and plans falls on all Category 1 responders but the Regulations permit them to collaborate with others in delivering the duty. It should be noted that voluntary sector and community groups may help responders to fulfil this duty but cannot discharge it on their behalf. Private sector organisations should also be encouraged to provide necessary advice and information where relevant (see also paragraph 7.25).7.12. There are several options for Category 1 responders in deciding how best to discharge their responsibility. They may decide to undertake the task:o on their own;o collaboratively, by agreeing with partners to act under the leadership of a lead responder; 5o jointly, by making arrangements with another Category 1 responder; 6 oro by delegating the task to another Category 1 responder.77.13. They may also support collaborative arrangements with the use of protocols. 8Maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public7.14. Category 1 responders are required to maintain arrangements to warn the public if an emergency is likely to occur or has occurred. In addition to warning, they must also have arrangements to provide information and advice to the public ifan emergency is likely to occur or has occurred.9

PAGE 5
7.15. The Act places a duty on Category 1 responders to maintain arrangements to warn. This reserves decisions about when, how, what and to whom warnings should be issued, to the local Category 1 responders themselves (see Figure 7.1). Plans, processes and protocols can be co-ordinated through the relevant warning and informing groups within the Local Resilience Forums. At the same time, there is a clear expectation that the arrangements to warn will be utilised where an emergency has occurred, making it necessary for responders to take action collectively to ensure a consistent messageIdentification of Category 1 responder with lead responsibility7.16. Confusion would be caused, if more than one Category 1 responder were to plan to warn the public about the same risk at the same time and to the same extent. To avoid duplication, the Regulations effectively support flexibility by requiring those Category 1 responders whose functions are affected by an emergency to co-operate for the purpose of identifying which organisation will take lead responsibility for maintaining arrangements to warn in regard to that particular emergency. 107.17. If agreement cannot be reached, each of them must maintain these arrangements separately, but should be mindful of the potential consequences of conflicting information. (Further guidance can be found later under “Who” – lead responder paragraph 7.94)7.18. The Regulations envisage two ways in which a lead responder for warning, informing and advising the public may be chosen:o by identification before an emergency; 11oro by adopting a procedure to be followed at the time of emergency.12
10 regulation 3211 regulation 32(3)(a)12 regulation 32(3)(b)
PAGE 6
7.19. In addition, a procedure may be adopted by which the role of lead responder may be changed from one Category 1 responder to another during the course of an emergency, including the recovery period.13 Co-operation to identify the lead responder for warning, informing and advising the public must identify which of these procedures has been chosen in relation to the particular emergency and include hand over protocols.7.20. Arrangements must ensure that at the time of an emergency, the Category 1 responder which has accepted the lead responsibility for warning, informing and advising the public:o is able to contact the other Category 1 responders whose functions are exercisable in relation to that emergency; 14o informs those Category 1 responders of the actions it is taking;15 ando is able to collaborate with those Category 1 responders in warning, informing and advising the public.167.21. The Regulations clearly envisage that the Category 1 responder with lead responsibility for warning, informing and advising the public will collaborate with its partners in fulfilling its role. There is no question of the lead responder assuming sole responsibility for carrying out the task. The Regulations place a reciprocal responsibility on those Category 1 responders which are not the lead responder, but which also have a duty to warn, inform and advise the public in relation to a particular emergency. They must maintain arrangements to:o consult with the lead responder in relation to that emergency on a regular basis;17 and
13 regulation 32(3)(c)14 regulation 33(2)(a)15 regulation 33(2)(b)16 regulation 33(2)(c)17 regulation 34(a)
PAGE 7
o inform the lead responder of the actions they are taking, and proposing to take, in relation to warning, informing and advising the public.187.22. The critical element in the effective delivery of information to the public will be the partnership established between the responder bodies involved and the sharing of information between them to ensure consistency.Joint discharge of functions7.23. Category 1 responders may also decide to deliver their responsibility to maintain arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public by:o making arrangements to operate jointly with another Category 1 responder; 19o delegating the task to another Category 1 responder. 20These collaborative arrangements, including the identification of a lead Category 1 responder for warning and informing, may be supported with the use of protocols.21Category 2 responders and other bodies7.24. Category 1 responders are not the sole responder bodies likely to be involved in arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public. The Regulations recognise that some Category 2 responders, such as utilities, have a duty under their own regulatory frameworks to provide warning, information and advice in certain circumstances when their services are interrupted. Similarly, the Meteorological18 regulation 34(b)19 regulation 8(a)20 regulation 8(b)21 regulation 7
Office, the Food Standards Agency and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which are not covered by the Act, also provide a warning service for a number of events including, for example, severe weather emergencies. Accordingly, the Regulations require that Category 1 responders in performing their duty to warn, inform and advise:o should have regard to these arrangements; 22 ando need not duplicate them unnecessarily. 237.25. It is important that responders consider how the CCA duty to communicate with the public interfaces with the duties contained in other site specific legislation such as the Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations 1999 (COMAH) (as amended 2005 and 2008) and the Radiation Emergency Preparedness and Public Information Regulations 2001 (REPPIR). Where possible, Category 1 and 2 responders as well as site operators should develop joint arrangements for communicating with the public. Further guidance on “The Fit with Other Legislation” can be found in Chapter 19.Have regard to emergency plans7.26. Warning, informing and advising the public is not a stand-alone duty. The Regulations require that a Category 1 responder in carrying out its duties in7.1. 
this respect must have regard to its emergency plans.24
As with any other part
of planning for the response to an emergency, the communications strategy - either direct with the public, or via the media - should be fully integrated into the responder’s emergency plans. Equally, in maintaining its emergency plans, it must have regard to its warning and informing duties.

PAGE 9
Generic and specific arrangements7.27. In regard to emergency planning, the Regulations distinguish between generic and specific plans. Similarly, in relation to the duty to have arrangements to warn, inform and advise the public, the Regulations recognise that these may be generic or specific.25 Which arrangements are chosen, will depend on the type of emergency being planned for and the particular circumstances in a locality.Training and exercises7.28. Emergency plans must include arrangements for the provision of training and7.1. 
carrying out of exercises.26
Similarly, the Regulations in regard to warning and
informing the public also require arrangements to include provision for training and exercises.27 It is recommended that exercises include warning and informing messages that test the public acceptance, acknowledgement and action on the messages. Simple, regular community engagement activities can assist in developing public awareness.How the Act and Regulations apply in Northern Ireland7.29. Regulations 32 to 34 do not apply to Category 1 organisations in relation to the delivery of their functions in Northern Ireland. In addition, the application to the transferred functions of the Police Service of Northern Ireland would be in accordance with arrangements set out in Chapter 12.25 regulation 2926 regulation 2527 regulation 31
Box 7.1: Further advice and information7.30. The previous section has described the nature of the legislation and what it permits and requires Category 1 responders to do. This section outlines how the duties described may best be carried out. It describes good practice.7.31. Communicating with the public is an integral part of preparing for and responding to incidents and cannot be done in isolation. The timely provision of relevant information and appropriate warnings and advice is a crucial part of the effort to promote and foster resilient communities. Responders need to consider how to warn and inform in conjunction with other aspects of the CCA, such as co-operation, information sharing, risk assessment, the role of the voluntary sector and other relevant legislation. These are set out elsewhere in Emergency Preparedness.7.1. 
7.32. At every stage of the process, the key to effective communication with the public is getting the message right for the right audience. Co-ordination between Category 1 responders is vital and every effort should be made to engage with Category 2 responders and the voluntary sector. Even when specific information has to be given by one body in a very specialist field, the others involved in the response should be aware of what is being issued, when and to whom. Arrangements to ensure that such co-ordination can take place effectively should be included in the planning process and assist in the smooth handover of responsibility if it is necessary.7.33. Advance preparation is essential and developing an outline communication strategy to deal with incidents is vital. When an incident/emergency occurs, this rolling strategy can be quickly developed to ensure a comprehensive and co-ordinated strategic communications approach is taken. This strategy however should continue to evolve over the duration of the incident to ensure that the most effective and appropriate action continues to be taken. Where possible, there should be a range of communications specialists involved in developing the strategy so that all communication disciplines, from free to paid media, e-media to direct mail, are considered.7.34. For the most part, public information should cover the interests of a number of different Category 1 responders involved in handling the emergency. All those with an interest need to contribute to the development of the information. Apparent conflicts of interest need to be resolved quickly. The stages in the decision-making process should be logged to provide a record which can be examined after the event to identify lessons for the future. Suitable systems should be devised as part of the planning process.7.35. Responders should be encouraged to set out a strategy for communicating with the public before, during and after a crisis. The key principles are set out under the following themes – when, what, how, who and to whom (see Fig 7.1) and are described under each heading in this Chapter:7.1. 
7.36. Annex 7D provides responders with details of The Ten Step Cycle, which aims to assist responders to meet the duty to communicate by setting out a step by step process to work through. It is seen as a continuous cycle and the process can be adapted to suit local needs and aid the planning process.Figure 7.1Public communications timeline: what responders’ plans need to achieve7.37. Although the duty is in two parts, there are three recognised stages to communicating with the public. There is a clear link between them and it is not always easy to separate them.7.1. 
Public awareness: developing understanding and preparedness before an emergency7.38. The more information the public have prior to an incident, the better prepared they are likely to be and the better able to respond appropriately to warnings and advice during an emergency. Past events and commissioned research have shown the population in the UK not to be particularly risk aware and to expect responders/ government to deal with emergencies as they occur, rather than preparing themselves to respond. Responders have a duty to make the public aware of the risks so that they can be encouraged to be more self-rescue orientated.7.39. Raising the awareness of children can help provide the long term solution to changing behaviour. Children absorb information and influence family behaviour; they can also influence the wider community.7.1. 

Risk communication / risk perception7.40. Effective warnings typically begin with risk communication and pre-incident public awareness campaigns that explain how individuals may receive emergency information, and actions the public can take to prepare for emergencies. Preparedness efforts also strengthen the credibility of, and compliance with, warnings and alerts.7.41. Understanding how people perceive and view risk is important as it can help responders tailor their communications appropriately and align messages with public perception. Perceptions are likely to vary widely across different cultures and groups. Perceptions will also be informed by a number of factors such as familiarity, control, vulnerability, timing, trust in authorities and social responsibility. How individuals perceive risks, both likelihood and impact, will influence their behaviour. High levels of risk perception are associated with higher levels of intended compliance and the tendency to act appropriately to warning information. However, there is comprehensive guidance available on how best to communicate about risks to the public without causing disproportionate concern, and Category 1 responders should be familiar with this.Public warning / alerting at the time of an emergency or when one is likely to occur7.42. An alert or warning needs to reach as many people as possible and as quickly as possible. Key communications objectives in an emergency response are to deliver accurate, clear and timely information and advice to the public so they feel confident, safe and well informed. Arrangements should be sufficiently flexible and extendable to address any escalation of events. Responders should alert the members of a community whose immediate safety is at risk by all appropriate means, and be mindful of using a variety of available channels and existing community resilience networks to reach community groups and vulnerable people.7.1. 
Recent examples of research that considered risk perception include:o Plymouth University “factors influencing risk perception, information spread and reliability”. The research sought to improve understanding of the psychological and behavioural reactions that the UK public might display following a CBRN related incident. It considered the need to design clear, comprehensible messages that meet the public’s information needs and whether these messages altered behavioural intentions. There was a need to use emergency communications to correct erroneous beliefs. The research developed evidence based guidelines for design of emergency communication based on literature review and research.o Kings’ College London noted that the management ofincidents involving CBRN risk is often complicated when members of the public adopt unexpected behaviours or display levels of fear that seem disproportionate to the level of threat that is involved. One of the key messages from this research wasthat the drive to maintain family contact is strong. Therefore emergency planners need to facilitate communication following an incident – prioritise information / advice about schools and reassure parents that schools have emergency plans. Preparation goes up at times of threat so remind the public of what preparations would be most effective.
Speed7.43. Responders should issue an early warning or alert of an incident as quickly as possible to help to save and/or protect lives. The initial alert may be hampered by the possible lack of information; therefore the warning/alert will be restricted to a very basic message or sound such as a siren or evacuation notification. As the incident unfolds, more detail can be given in warning messages.7.1. 
Figure 7.2Amount of information	Number of people to reachInforming and advising7.44. Responders need to provide relevant and timely information about the nature of the unfolding event and this should continue throughout the event. The demand for more and more information will increase, and the advice given will become more specific. Information should include an explanation of the immediate actions being taken by responders to minimise the risk to human or animal health and welfare, the environment or property; actions being taken by responders to assist the recovery phase, as well as the actions the public themselves can take to minimise the impact of the emergency and details of how further information can be obtained.7.1. 
7.45. It is also important for responders to communicate the end of the emergency and the return to normal arrangements. Good communication should be maintained in the recovery phase as people will require ongoing advice and information.Awareness7.46. At national level, more information has been put in the public domain. The National Risk Register (http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/national- risk-register) explains how the government regularly assesses the natural hazards and manmade threats that could affect the UK. It explains the likelihood of a risk occurring and possible effects of an emergency if it happens.7.47. Generic advice to the public on how to prepare for emergencies is available as part of the Community Resilience Programme launched in March 2011. This programme aims to encourage individuals and communities to become more aware of the risks they face and think about what actions they could take7.1. 
to reduce the impacts of emergencies and to make their community more resilient.  More information about the Community Resilience Programme can be found at : www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/communityresilience. From time to time, government also undertakes national campaigns through TV and press advertising.7.48. The DirectGov website has information for the general public on what to do to prepare for emergencies and, in the event of an emergency occurring, it can carry key messages and signpost the public to different relevant sites for further information. This can be found at www.direct.gov.uk/preparingforemergencies.7.49. The key central advice in the event of an incident is summarised by the phrase “Go in, Stay in, Tune in”. This is targeted at those who are not involved in the incident, but are close by or believe themselves to be in danger. There will be occasions when this message is not applicable, and responders should be ready to give instruction on the best course of action to take in the circumstances.Box 7.2: Public information produced by central government and national bodies
7.50. Once Category 1 responders have identified the emergencies that will trigger their public communication duties through the risk assessment process (Chapter 4), they should consider what information is already in the public domain. This will help them determine what additional information from the risk assessments and plans they have made they should publish to meet the requirements of their duties. 287.51. The generic material is likely to be supported by the Community Risk Register (CRR) and Category 1 responders’ generic planning arrangements. Specific plans, prepared in relation to specific risks and also supported by the CRR, are likely to include a requirement for much more detailed advice to the public on what may happen.Awareness-raising: what the public should do in an emergency7.52. The Act requires information to be published about the risks and plans. Under the Act, plans describe the actions the Category 1 responders themselves will take in the event of an emergency. However, in practice, Category 1 responders may also want to attach to their plans details of possible useful actions that the public could do to help themselves. These may include obtaining in advance useful protective or preventive materials or other items to ensure community resilience in an emergency. It makes28 s. 2(1)(f)
sense for public awareness messages to include what the public should do in the face of the risk of emergency, to complement the actions that the Category 1 responders themselves propose to take. More information and advice is available through the Community Resilience Programme at www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/communityresilience.7.53. Many local authorities and other bodies have websites and literature which provide either generic advice on emergencies, or detailed advice specific to their own areas of responsibility.7.54. Each decision will clearly have to be based on a balance of assessment. Two types of publication may be found to be necessaryo generic advice referring to the risks of emergencies in the locality; ando specific advice linked to particular risks and plans.The information should be designed to encourage members of the public to be prepared for the risks that they are most likely to face.
Box 7.3: Examples of locally produced or topical Information
How much to publish7.55. The objective of this duty under the Act needs to be kept in mind. At all stages of the decision-making process, Category 1 responders should ask themselves whether the material published will enhance the public’s response in an emergency. In this regard, the mere fact of publication may have a beneficial effect on public confidence. Research suggests that people look to the authorities to ‘do something’, and that they will be relieved and reassured to see that plans are in place.Unnecessary alarm7.56. Any inclination towards full disclosure may be tempered by the requirement to “have regard to the need to avoid alarming the public unnecessarily”. 29 Responders should consider the benefits of reducing the classification of sensitive information through various means to improve public understanding of risks and to establish some of the good practice highlighted in this chapter.7.57. Information relating to events, particularly terrorist events, where the consequences would include mass fatalities and casualties could be unsettling and upsetting. However, there is a clear need to strike a balance between not causing public alarm and providing necessary information to enable people to understand the threat and respond in an appropriate manner in the event of an incident occurring. There is no evidence to suggest the public panics when receiving information. They want to feel they have all the relevant facts so that they can take informed decisions. Communication needs to be handled sensitively. Responders should use clear terminology, providing factual information which avoids sensationalism or emotive language. The content should not be overly negative or graphic, and should be asbrief as possible to avoid confusing or overwhelming readers.29 regulations 27, 30
Relevant research includes:Sussex University Social PsychologySussex psychologist Dr John Drury has published the first social-psychological study of crowd reactions among survivors of the London bombings on 7 July 2005.One of the key findings in the research was that – “there was no ‘mass panic’ and little selfishness, despite the fact that people felt in danger of death, saw little hope of escape and were mostly among strangers.” Research has found evidence that, in emergencies, rather than panic, some people have a delayed reaction to alarm signals and warning signs. To counter this, researchers have suggested that traditional alarms could be replaced by more advanced mass communication tools, such as public- address systems and LED screens, to inform the evacuating crowd of the seriousness and location of danger. www.sussex.ac.uk/affiliates/panic/index.htmlNATO guidelines on psychosocial care for people affected by disasters and major incidents. www.healthplanning.co.uk/nato/
Public warning / alertingWhat information is needed and when7.58. Immediately when an emergency occurs, and during the first hour, the public needs:o basic details of the incident - what, where, when (and who, why and how, if possible);o to know the implications for health and welfare;o advice and guidance (e.g. stay indoors, symptoms, preparing for evacuation); ando reassurance (if necessary).o 
The public wants to know:o practical implications such as the effect on traffic, power supplies, telephones, water supplies, etc;o a helpline number; ando what is being done to resolve the situation.Broadcasters will require:o well thought out and joined-up arrangements between the emergency services, local authority and other organisations, capable of providing agreed information at speed;o an immediate telephone contact; ando a media rendezvous point at the scene.7.59. Responders need to take into account what the public wants to know not simply what the authorities need to say. Understanding how emergency communication will be perceived and acted upon by the public will help to achieve greater success in compliance. Responders also need to consider how technical information can be communicated in a way that the public will understand.7.60. Responders need to consider the potential for disparity between local and national messages. Ensuring consistency and clarity of messaging in the context of potentially differing approaches and experiences is key to successful UK-wide response to emergencies. Responders should explain why national messages might differ from local messages and ensure that local media are aware of the importance of local information.7.1. 
7.61. There will often be a number of routes through which messages are disseminated, and to avoid inconsistent or conflicting messaging, they should be synchronised and checked to ensure that the data is correct. A common information picture should be shared at all levels. The News Co-ordination Centre (NCC) will help to co-ordinate the information activities at a national level – see Annex 7A for further information on the NCC.7.62. Category 1 responders should not release, (without consultation), information or advice which covers the areas of responsibility of partner organisations. The damage done to public confidence by the release of inconsistent or contradictory messages can be hard to repair. Similarly, great damage can be done by speculation about causes or future developments when facts are not known.Informing and advising7.63. It is important to maintain a flow of information and provide the public with practical information in the mid and longer term following a major incident, and signpost individuals to sources of additional support. It is essential to recognise that some communication outlets may not be available for the long term distribution of essential information to the public and alternative methods should be established.7.1. 
7.64. Local authorities co-ordinate the provisions of welfare support to the community and take on a key role in the recovery phase of emergencies. Local authorities have their own websites which can provide people with information on services available. Other mechanisms include individual and public meetings; one stop shops; use of media and mailing; as well as using existing voluntary/community networks.
Pre-event information7.65. The simplest and most cost-effective solution may be to make all or part of the relevant documents available in downloadable web format. For those who do not have internet access, paper copies can be made available on request and in the reference sections of public libraries.7.66. Available information should be identified clearly in the responder Freedom of Information Publication Scheme. 3030 The Freedom of Information Act requires each public authority to adopt and maintain a publication scheme setting out details of information it will routinely make available, how the information can be obtained and whether there is any charge for it. A publication scheme is therefore both a public commitment to make certain information available and a guide to how that information can be obtained. All publication schemes have to be approved by the Information Commissioner and should be reviewed by authorities periodically to ensure they are accurate and up to date. More information can be found at http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk

Design and distribution7.67. All material produced should look interesting and attractive enough for people to want to read it, otherwise it may be a waste of resources.7.68. It is a good idea to seek professional design and editing assistance. If professional support is not available, advice on good practice is available online and in published manuals.7.69. Once a product is available, the public will need to know about it. Unless it is going to be mailed directly to householders, people will need to be told how to get copies. This may be achieved by the conventional range of publicity methods.7.70. Avoiding duplication of effort is important. Good communication between responder bodies should include development of joint programmes for the production of general information material.7.71. It is good professional practice to evaluate the effectiveness of every information campaign. If this is done, evaluation should include research which shows how well any specialist versions have met the needs of vulnerable members of the community.7.1. 
Reaching vulnerable persons and those who have difficulty understanding the message7.72. The needs of vulnerable people will be evident in some areas, which have, for example, a high proportion of elderly residents who may welcome the option of a large print version of a document, or where there may be significant numbers who speak a minority ethnic language. Where vulnerable members of the community are in the care of an institution such as a school or old people’s home, the most effective delivery of information will be through the management. Where vulnerable members of the community are not cared for within an institution, local responders should consider going through interest groups or voluntary sector organisations to disseminate messages. It may be that the most effective communications route is a single leaflet expressed in very simple language (or more than one language) backed up with pictures and symbols, which includes a request that the reader should share the information with family, friends and neighbours who are not able to read the information themselves. Research shows that it can be particularly effective to communicate with children, who then act as a conduit for the message to reach other family members. It should include a link to Directgov emergency pages which have useful prompts/questions to encourage people to be prepared. The Red Cross has produced a family of products and resources to inform and prepare organisations, communities and individuals to work together, at www.informedprepared.eu.7.1. 
7.73. Vulnerable groups will be a changing entity depending on the event (e.g. hard of hearing, elderly, transient population, etc) and might change during the event. Responders need to use a variety of different communication methods to help to capture these vulnerable groups. Responders should consider issues such as language and methods of communicating: mobile phones may not be used by some people, radios and televisions may not be on late at night, etc.7.74. Vulnerable people who live in residential homes or sheltered accommodation or attend day centres etc. are relatively easy to identify and therefore it will be easier to put arrangements in place to warn during an emergency because the establishment will be known to local authorities and other responders.7.75. Vulnerable people living in the community are more difficult to contact.General advice to the public to adopt a ‘good neighbour’ approach to help those less able to help themselves is always advisable; but specific efforts will sometimes be needed by the public authorities to deliver alerts to those vulnerable people who are known to them.  Local community groups preparing for emergencies or local emergency groups (such as neighbourhood policing – Safer Community Teams) may be a useful way to identify and get information to vulnerable people.7.76. The Category 1 responder with lead responsibility for communicating with the public will need to be assured that these vulnerable people can be contacted. Arrangements will need to address how information and assistance can be managed by local authorities and health authorities who are in regular contact with the vulnerable individuals.7.1. 
7.77. People who have difficulty understanding the message because they use a different language may require pre-prepared print or broadcast messages in their own language.Review and renewal7.78. The provision of public information should be an ongoing process. Any information that is produced should be in a reasonably durable format, whether paper or electronic, and should be available over time. It should be regularly reviewed and renewed whenever necessary in the light of changing circumstances. LRFs might want to agree a schedule for review.7.79. This will mean that published material will need to be looked at afresh every time the CRR or an individual risk assessment or plan changes. Only new information which is “necessary or desirable” for prevention or mitigation of an emergency will require a new version to be produced.
7.80. The methods available to deliver urgent information to members of the public are extremely varied. A mix of techniques should be utilised to maximise the chance of receipt, comprehension & effective response from the public. Some depend on the availability of power supplies or phone lines. Some may require careful consideration of the risks to human life and health, in case, at the time of an emergency, staff or members of the public are exposed to hazardous substances while they are warning or being warned. Arrangements for complementary and co-ordinated public warnings, advice and media facilities should be carefully managed between the various bodies. This will enhance public safety and information will be delivered more effectively.7.1.

Figure 7.3 Process for developing effective warning proceduresThe process of reaching agreement on the warning process is shown schematically in Figure 7.3.Generic and Specific WarningsSome systems are defined as ‘generic’ arrangements,31 in that they can be called into play in a range of scenarios. Others have only limited use, or are capable of delivering only a closely targeted message.Warning during a malicious incidentThe police will lead in any malicious incident, including terrorist attacks, and have primary responsibility for providing effective and timely information to the public. Communication strategies will be developed for specific scenarios. There will be a need to balance rapid dissemination of warnings whilst ensuring accuracy. It is recognised there may be little specific information during the initial stage of an incident and confirmation of detailed facts will take longer.
7.84. When developing the warning in response to a malicious incident, the potential for any planned secondary attack should be considered in determining an evacuation route for the public. The means of delivering the message to the public also needs to be considered to ensure public safety and to avoid further potential damage. Additionally, responders should be aware of the different arrangements for media relations for such an event, as it will most likely be nationally led, with local delivery. Where credible and specific threats to national security are identified in advance, information is handled at a national level and public warnings issued by the police and/or Home Secretary. Any threat connected with international terrorism will be a national – even international – issue and information about it will be co-ordinated centrally regardless of what part of the country is under threat.Existing publication and warning regimes7.85. Some organisations excluded from the Act because they have existing statutorily defined emergency procedures, also have an important role in generating public awareness about emergencies and issuing warnings when necessary. The management of emergencies on nuclear and major industrial sites, including communicating with the public, is already regulated. Site operators have well-established procedures for communicating with the public in the vicinity of their sites. The CCA legal framework does not override existing ones. It will be important to ensure that plans made by Category 1 responders do not duplicate existing arrangements. Category 1 responders may choose to cover in their communications planning the potential for an emergency to spread beyond the scope of individual site plans produced under the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations, Radiation (Emergency Preparation and Public Information) Regulations or pipeline regimes, but this is not an explicit requirement of the Act.7.1. 
7.86. Consistency of message is important in an emergency situation and Category 1 responders should have regard to the early advice and information relayed to the public by Category 2 responders and site owners/operators. Category 1 responders should seek to enhance this communication.7.87. Category 1 responders should consider the options available in detail as part of the planning process to ensure that they have an adequate range of methods at their disposal. No single system will be the solution to all situations or achieve a wholly resilient alerting capability. A variety of methods will always be necessary to capture the largest proportion of the target audience. Differentinformationsourcesappealtodifferentdemographicgroups. Anindividual who receives multiple but consistent messages is likely to respond favourably. Overlapping methods help to ensure a higher level of successful access to the targeted population.7.88. Alerting systems also need to be resilient. Much can be achieved through trusted stakeholders and low-technology solutions. Indeed, these may be the most resilient to disruption to telecommunications and power. Using trusted stakeholders (such as building managers to communicate with their tenants) allows the public to receive messages from a known (and possibly more trusted) source.7.1. 
7.89. The need for back-up staff and equipment, and the risk of warning arrangements being disrupted by the emergency itself, should all be considered in business continuity management plans.Types of warning methodPossible public warning methodsCapabilityo		Mobilising officers to go round on foot and knock on doorsgenerico	From car or helicopter, by loudhailer or other amplified meansgenerico		National and local media (TV, radio, online)generic or specifico	Social Media generic or specificgeneric or specifico	Electronic/variable message boards,e.g. at the roadside or on motorways generic or specificgeneric or specifico		Variable message signs (some authorities have protocols in place to utilise these in emergencies)specifico		Direct radio broadcasts to shipping (in maritime incidents)generic or specifico		PA announcements in public buildings, shopping centres, sports venues, transport systemsgeneric oro		Automated telephone/fax/e-mail/ text messages to subscribersspecifico	Site sirensspecific
Helplines and public inquiry points7.90. The information delivery methods discussed so far have been based upon the Category 1 responders’ decision about what information needs to be provided. However the public are likely to have all sorts of queries and perhaps offers, to direct towards the responder bodies. Responders should plan how to make best use of helplines and public inquiry points (which may be telephone, e-mail or SMS based, or multimedia) in any emergency. These can either provide a limited amount of recorded information, or connect with a call centre where people answer individual questions.7.91. Helplines may already be in place for other purposes. Plans can be developed to take them over and provide their staff with relevant briefing or suitable recorded messages. Facilities run by other operators or companies in the area may also be co-opted into the public information effort as a result of protocols put in place in advance.7.1. 
7.92. Setting up a dedicated call centre from scratch is a significant undertaking, but may be achieved quite quickly if suitable call-off contracts have been put in place as part of the planning process. The Police Casualty Bureau and the Consulate Crisis Group of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office regularly operate effective call centres. Responders might also consider working with voluntary sector organisations, for example, through the British Red Cross to provide this function as they may have the capability. However, it is essential to ensure that the people working at the call centres are competent, fully briefed and provided with a core brief. It is important to consider the capacity of the system, and Category 1 responders should take advice from network providers to avoid the risk of overloading the telephone system.7.93. Such inquiry points are not a panacea. There will always be a significant proportion of dissatisfied callers, whatever the method used - callers for whom the recorded message is inadequate or unsuitable, or who cannot get answers to their particular questions, or who simply cannot get through because the lines are too busy. Planning should address the management of callers expectations, to limit irritation and disappointment, by establishing procedures to make it clear what information is available and how busy the lines are.
The fact that the casualty bureau does not provide information directly over the phone places an onus on Category 1 responders (for example local authorities), as part of integrated emergency management, to plan to set up a public information line. This may be achieved through the use of the British Red Cross co-ordinated support line, provided through its Memorandum of Understanding with the Association of Chief Police Officers, or through the use of the voluntary sector delivered facility referred to in paragraph 7.91. Such support lines do not provide information about casualties, of course, but they may be able to provide callers with a range of practical and emotional support, including the provision of travel and accommodation advice to relatives and friends who may wish to come to the area. Planning to provide public information lines will help ease the burden on the casualty bureau.Planning should also include special arrangements in the local area to provide face-to-face information and support to those bereaved relatives who come to be close to the scene of the emergency. The police are likely to provide Family Liaison Officers who will take on all or part of this role. But special attention needs to be paid to relatives and friends trying to get information at receiving hospitals for the incident; and to those who may be taken to, or congregate at, the emergency mortuary. Rest and reception centres set up by the local authority with the support of voluntary organisations may also require regularly updated access to information and advice.
Identifying a lead responder7.94. It is preferable, in relation to particular types of emergency, if a lead responder for warning, informing and advising the public is identified and agreed beforehand by the Category 1 responders. Annex 7B provides an indicative list of which Category 1 responders are likely to lead in a range of examples. (The list is advisory only). Step 3 of the 10 Step Cycle (Annex 7D) offers further guidance on identifying a lead responder.Case Study: North Yorkshire Local Resilience Forum Media and Communications PlanThe NYLRF Media, Warning and Informing group has produced a Communications and Media Plan which included a specific appendix on identifying the lead responder. The group approached this by classifying the types of risk and looking at the risk register and agreeing to focus on high and very high risks rather than the register as a whole. All parties then agreed who would generally lead on communications and/or media during that type of emergency.The communications plan itself was very short and its focus was on the 11 appendices which had specific details and actions as well as detailing the needs of the media during an incident.To look at the NYLRF plan or the lead responder sheet please visit www.emergencynorthyorks.gov.uk and contact the emergency planning unit emergency@northyorks.gov.uk for a username and password.
7.95. In many instances, the lead Category 1 responder for warning and informing the public will be the organisation which leads on the response to an emergency. In a number of instances, this role is likely to be filled by the police, but it should not be assumed that this will always be the case. The lead responder for the recovery phase will normally be the Local Authority. It is essential the public continue to receive appropriate information during the recovery phase.7.96. A wide area emergency such as flooding is a good example of how responders all have to play their part. It is clear that the role of lead Category 1 responder for warning, informing and advising, is likely to fall in England to the Environment Agency, in this instance, but that does not absolve non-lead responders from playing their part. When a potential flood impinges on the functions of another Category 1 body, then it too has a duty to warn, for example, where it is likely that the flood will require a response from the local authority or the police, e.g. because the flood will impact on the delivery of education or the welfare of clients on a social services care list or, in the case of the police, because lives and property will be at risk. The Agency is also responsible for warning other responders, who must make decisions on, for example, evacuation, in the same way it does the public. In similar wide area examples, such as health emergencies, the lead Category 1 responder with responsibility for warning and informing will be a health organisation, but it will also require assistance from other Category 1 responders. Different bodies may undertake the lead Category 1 response role in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.7.97. Where identification of the Category 1 organisation taking the lead responder role for warning, informing and advising cannot be done in advance, the Regulations permit a procedure to be established for identifying at the time of an event who should be the lead responder. However, choosing this option may cause unwanted delay and confusion. A possible example where Category 1 responders might want to delay identifying a lead responder could be a severe weather emergency. Even so, in Annex7.1. 
7D, it is suggested that the police should be identified in advance for the lead role in this type of wide area emergency, where the likely impact is on road traffic. They, of course, would expect to be supported by a range of other Category 1 responders.7.98. Procedures may also be adopted for changing the lead responder with responsibility for warning, informing and advising during the course of an emergency. On land, the police, and in maritime emergencies, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency are likely to co-ordinate warning and information strategies in the early stages of many emergencies. In the later stages, the lead in distributing information and advice about longer-term issues, for example, connected to health or the environment, may be handed over to the relevant expert organisation.Use of Protocols7.99. Category 1 responders are likely to want to support these arrangements with protocols.32 (A checklist of possible protocols appears at Annex 7C). These may be negotiated directly or through the LRF.7.100. Protocols should be recorded formally and in some detail, so that they can be implemented immediately in the event of an emergency. They should describe the process which will be used to identify stages in the emergency when the lead communicator responsibility ought to be changed during the handover from response to recovery, and the point at which normal operating practices should be resumed and reviewed.32 regulation 7
Role of the lead responder7.101. The planning arrangements of the lead responder for warning, informing and advising the public are likely to include:o Procedures and a capability for:ï contacting other relevant responder organisations and informing them of action being undertakenor proposed;ï delivering urgent emergency warnings, or ensuring they are delivered;ï co-ordinating all communications activity at the timeof an emergency, so that public information is consistent, timely and without unnecessary duplication;ï delivering information and advice in relation to its functional areas of responsibility;ï assisting other participating responder organisations to deliver information and provide advice in relationto their functional responsibilities.o Provision of:ï a media facility;ï a lead spokesperson to work with the media;ï facilities for staff from different responder organisations to work together on a public information service.o Procedures for:ï handing over the role to another lead Category 1 responder as determined by the course of events.ï 
Who delivers?7.102. How information and advice are delivered can greatly affect how they are received.Category 1 responders should give careful thought to this ahead of any emergency, and should identify individuals who may act as official spokespeople and undertake media interviews. These individuals should receive suitable training.7.103. If the figure is already recognised as a trustworthy and authoritative person, the message will be delivered all the more effectively. This might be because they already have a good public profile in the area or are in uniform (research shows that the public have great confidence in spokespeople from the emergency services).7.104. In addition to those who will be taking a frontline media role, it is important that other staff who may come into direct contact with the public (receptionists, security and switchboard staff, for example) are provided with at least a basic level of information and can handle inquiries confidently.7.105. Category 1 responders are, required in the Act to make local arrangements for delivering information and advice about an emergency to the public with the purpose of mitigating the effects and aiding recovery. They should plan to be able to meet the needs of many different audiences. These can be grouped as follows :7.1. 
Survivors (Group A) and others affected by the emergency (Group B)7.106. The needs of these two groups are the main focus of attention in the initial response to an incident and beyond.7.107. Providing information to Group A is, in effect, an extension of the warning phase.Those at the scene are under direct instruction from the emergency services. Those in charge of operations are best placed to decide what advice or instructions are required, by whom and how quickly.
7.108. Group B urgently need to know what they need to do immediately - this may be a message to stay indoors and shut windows, to evacuate, to follow decontamination instructions, or to report somewhere for medical checks. Planning should address these issues. Group B may also need (and certainly will want) to know why the advice is being given.7.109. Responders should take into account different response behaviours and tailor their messages appropriately. The majority of people need leadership and direction; some need to be controlled. Messages should focus on encouraging positive actions. Group behaviour can manifest itself positively (helping others) or negatively (endangering others), but the majority of individuals are likely to need some level of support.7.110. In the earliest moments following an incident, vital operational decisions are often made by the first police officers, emergency workers or even members of the public at the scene. Pre-planning should ensure that decisions about the nature and timing of advice to the public have a prominent place among the urgent matters to be dealt with. If official information is not quickly communicated to the public, there is a greater risk of inaccurate information from informal sources (such as SMS text or social networking messages) becoming widely spread and accepted.7.111. Responders are unlikely to be able to rely solely on the media to reach the Group B audience. Planning should recognise that targeting will need to be more precise than can be achieved by broadcasters. Procedures should include some form of audit trail of who has or has not been contacted. The media may be used to provide basic safety messages.7.1. 
Local people (Group C), friends and relatives (Group D)7.112. Local media can be particularly helpful in addressing Group C, providing general information about the emergency, information on how the public can help and advice on disruption in the area, e.g. traffic bulletins. It is important for communications planning to ensure that Group C, in particular, can get access to regular progress updates.7.113. Category 1 responders should work closely with the media, especially local radio, ahead of time to prepare useful standard material. The text of announcements should, where possible, be agreed with broadcasters in advance to avoid unnecessary questions of editorial control under pressure.7.114. Group D will usually be alerted to an emergency through the national media. The most likely first response is to phone the people they know in the area, either to find out if they are safe or to get more information.7.115. There is evidence from past disasters that the emotional impact of watching the unfolding of events which may be affecting a close relative or friend can be very significant. Where people at a distance can be reasonably sure that a relative or friend is caught up in the incident they will be desperate for information. The Police Casualty Bureau will be a prime information tool. Communications planning must address this reality.The wider audience (Groups E and F)7.116. Group E are effectively ‘the public at large’. Their principal source of information is news broadcasts and whatever they can find on websites.7.1. 
7.117. The media (Group F) are the sixth audience for the information provided by Category 1 responders. They can influence both the short-term handling and the long-term impact of an emergency.7.118. The news media (broadcasting, print and text services) remain the primary means of communication with the public. The public’s picture of a crisis is largely shaped by the media. The need for information in a crisis is huge, and mass media are nearly always first and have the greatest impact. A false or inaccurate picture will be difficult to adjust later. Consequently, communication with the media has to work from the start and information from Category 1 responders should be as accurate and complete as possible.Working with the media7.119. While Category 1 responders have little control over the output on news channels, it is important that plans are in place to agree what the main public messages will be, to provide the media with as much relevant material as possible and to ensure it is accurate, consistent and regularly updated.7.120. As part of a general information strategy, in advance of an emergency, the media can help to raise public awareness of the issues and provide information about what to do if one occurs.7.121. More importantly, in the wake of an emergency, the media can deliver specific advice and information to large numbers of affected people more quickly and effectively than any other means of delivery. This can take any form, from short, simple messages repeated across all formats, to explanatory interviews and extensive background material on websites. The written press can deliver complex information and advice which people need to retain over a number of days or7.1. 
weeks. The media have ways of quickly reaching many different audiences with specific needs - the deaf, the blind, and those who do not speak English, for example. Radio, in particular, is the most resilient form of mass communication, available even if power and phone lines are down, via battery or wind-up portable radios and car radios.7.122. At the same time as providing useful advice and information to the public, the media are likely to operate in reporting mode. They may well produce round-the-clock rolling news coverage if the emergency is serious enough. It is important that Category 1 responders should have plans to play their part in providing authoritative information and spokespeople for interview, to ensure that the public gets a fair picture of how they are handling the situation, and to counter any inaccurate information, such as from informal sources like social networking websites. The needs of foreign broadcasters who work to different time zones/scales should also be considered.7.123. Planning should recognise that the media will seize upon any inconsistencies in presentation or message, either between responders at the local level, or between local and national responses. It is vital that Category 1 responders are equipped to liaise effectively with each other and with regional and UK bodies, otherwise the operation may appear chaotic.7.124. If the media do not get the information they want from Category 1 responders, they are likely to go elsewhere for footage and commentary. This may lead to a loss of messaging control for Category 1 responders, and put them in a position of having to defend themselves against unfounded criticism or inaccurate analysis. Category 1 responders should be aware that the handling of the emergency, as well as the emergency itself, will all be part of the story. No matter how positive relations are with the media ahead of an event, responders must expect to be criticised if events seem to be going badly. They should plan accordingly.7.1.

All Category 1 responders should be familiar with the media organisations and outlets in their own area and should develop good relations with them. Discussion with the media ahead of an event helps ensure that all parties can operate more effectively on the day, by preparing useful standard background material in advance, planning practical arrangements and building trust and confidence on all sides. This can be achieved through geographically based multi-forum groups (such as media emergency forums), which bring together the media and emergency planning communications specialists. In many areas, particularly those where there are long-standing known hazards, such as nuclear power stations or extensive industrial complexes, there are also local groupings with members from Category 1 and 2 responders, other organisations not covered by the Act, as well as the media. These are quite often chaired by local police representatives.The BBC’s local radio service is recognised as an emergency broadcaster for the UK and its editors can be contacted for advice and to agree contact details and processes in the event of an emergency. Planning before a crisis is key and the importance of a good pre-existing relationship between those in the media and those involved in emergency planning and work during a crisis cannot be overestimated. Editors contact details can be found via the BBC’s ‘Connecting in a Crisis’ framework 3.3The media landscape is continuing to develop. Some of the biggest growth has been in online news services. The media, particularly the broadcast media, can expect huge demand for their online service.Mobile phones with cameras and other similar devices mean that the public are able to publish their own content. Within seconds of a disaster, pictures can be broadcast around the world, sometimes before the emergency services have had a chance to respond.
33 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15250977
7.129. The broadcast media are much more audience focused and their questions will reflect audience concerns. They are also aware that big emergencies attract big audiences and responders need to be prepared to deal with such large numbers.
Social media7.130. Recent years have seen an exponential growth in the use of social media by society and, as such, it is an area that emergency responders cannot ignore; whilst having little control over it. The COI guidance Engaging through Social Media http://www.coi.gov.uk/documents/Engaging_through_social_media.pdf outlines the advantages and issues for consideration across a range of day-to-day government roles.7.131. The communications landscape has significantly shifted with the advent and development of social media. It has a role to play in preparing for, responding to and recovering from emergencies. It provides emergency responders with the capability to engage in two-way communication with the public in real- time, potentially sending messages ‘virally’ and, in doing so, creating a number of believable spokespersons. Analysis of social media can also aid situational awareness and better understanding of the working context.7.132. The benefits that social media can provide are clear. However, there are risks to its usage and these should be evaluated before deployment:o As an ‘opt-in’ service, it can be difficult to attract users in advance of events, ensuring they receive messages encouraging preparedness.o Messages can be altered and spoofed once transmitted which may cause the integrity of the message to be compromised.o Responders will want to be aware of activity on social media sitesand engage where possible to counter erroneous messages. Providing links through to official websites may help to alleviate this tosome extent.
7.133. LRFs may also wish to consider the benefits of agreeing a multi-agency social media protocol to ensure usage is consistent with both individual, and multi-organisational policy.Examples of use of social media:West Yorkshire Police used social media during demonstrations by the English Defence League and United Against Fascism in Bradford City Centre over the August Bank Holiday 2010. They monitored online forums and other social media to gather intelligence and identify potential partners and problems. The Police used channels such as Twitter and YouTube to update the media and spread key messages. An online forum was established through Huddle (www.huddle.com) to share materials and flag potential issues; a Daily Information Update for key partners was produced.The use and misuse of social media was again demonstrated during the public disorder in England during the summer 2011.ï No 10 Downing Street offers a host of social media channels including Flickr, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. @number10govï The Highlands and Islands Strategic Co-ordinating Group (HISCG) have a Twitter page http://twitter.com/NorthernPolice and http://twitter.com/handiprepared.ï http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2010/10/21/wheres-safe-creating-a-tool-to- guide-people-in-an-emergency/ï Birmingham Resilience Team has a website which contains managed feeds: Vimeo, Flickr, Facebook and Twitter.ï www.birminghamprepared.gov.ukï 
Exercise and review7.134. It is important to exercise arrangements for communicating with the public. Public communications and media planning can be effectively tested in tabletop or full- scale exercises. These should be conducted regularly.7.135. Both the media and the public can take part in exercises. This can help to make them more realistic and will increase the challenge for participants. It will also help to promote community resilience messages.7.136. It will often be beneficial to involve some media as players in the exercise. News organisations with a role in reporting emergencies benefit from rehearsing their arrangements too. Where the exercise scenario involves security issues, it may not be possible to achieve full media involvement. However, it should, in most cases, be possible to agree effective rules that allow the media to participate without running news stories about the event. Media contacts, especially out of hours contacts, should be updated at least twice a year.7.137. Category 1 responders have always been sensitive to appearing to be underprepared, but with positive relations with the media established in ‘normal’ conditions, it should be possible to demonstrate how problems are being identified and remedied ahead of a real event.7.1. 
7.138. In tandem with these arrangements, Category 1 responders should also consider the role of exercises in building public confidence. Research shows that providing the public, through the media, with information about exercises that are taking place and showing pictures of what they may expect to happen can be extremely reassuring.7.139. When developing exercises, responders should consider inviting local media to cover the story as observers. The ground rules should be agreed in advance, with assistance from the appropriate media groups/forums as necessary.7.1.

Chapter 8 (Business continuity advice and assistance to business and the voluntary sector) of Emergency Preparedness, Revised VersionSummaryï The Act requires local authorities to provide advice and assistance to those undertaking commercial activities and to voluntary organisations in relation to business continuity management (BCM) in the event of an emergency (as defined by the Act) (paragraphs 8.1-8.8).ï Local authorities must provide general advice and assistance to the business and voluntary sector communities at large; may provide specific advice and assistance to individual organisations; and may give advice and assistance to individual businesses in relation to the engagement of business continuity consultants (paragraphs 8.8-8.22).ï Not all voluntary organisations would want - or benefit from - business continuity advice. A local authority may therefore define its own voluntary sector audience, targeting efforts where they will add most value (paragraphs 8.28-8.31).ï Local authorities may charge for advice and assistance provided on request, on a cost-recovery basis (paragraphs 8.34-8.35).ï Local authorities should have regard to relevant Community Risk Registers (CRRs) when developing an advice and assistance programme (paragraphs 8.36-8.37).ï Local authorities may enter into collaborative arrangements with other Category 1 and 2 responders in fulfilling their duties (paragraphs 8.38-8.41).ï 
ï Local authorities within a Local Resilience Forum (LRF) area are required to co-operate with each other in performing their duties; other Category 1 and 2 responders within a Local Resilience Forum are required to co-operate with local authorities (paragraphs 8.42-8.52).ï Local authorities are required to have regard to the BCM advice and assistance provided by other Category 1 and 2 responders to business and voluntary organisations in their areas (paragraphs 8.46-8.52).ï This chapter also sets out the considerations local authorities should take into account when developing a programme of advice and assistance (e.g. key messages, established support networks) (paragraphs 8.57-8.74).ï Local authorities should consider how to use the arrangements for multi-agency co-operation established by the Act to ensure BCM advice and assistance programmes are co-ordinated and effective (paragraphs 8.70-8.72).ï Local authorities have been discharging the business continuity duty since its commencement in May 2006. In this time a number of different methods have been used to reach out to local businesses. Some of these have been recorded as case studies, attached as an annex to this chapter.ï 
 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE	8.1. Scope of the dutyThe Act requires local authorities to provide advice and assistance to those undertaking commercial activities and to voluntary organisations in their areas
in relation to BCM in the event of emergencies (as defined in the Act).1 activity is undertaken to ensure preparedness.Rationale for the duty
This
8.2. The duty on local authorities to give advice and assistance to business and voluntary organisations in relation to business continuity management (BCM) is an integral part of the Act’s wider contribution to building the UK’s resilience to disruptive challenges.8.3. In the event of an emergency, Category 1 responders will give all the assistance they can, but there is merit in ensuring that communities themselves are resilient. In particular, it is important to ensure that the impact of an emergency on the continuity of commercial and voluntary organisations is kept to a minimum. This will lessen the economic and social impact of emergencies and speed up recovery.8.4. Establishing a source of BCM advice and assistance prior to an emergency occurring will raise business continuity awareness in the community, and help organisations to help themselves in case of an incident.
1 s.4
PAGE 4
8.5. A programme of business continuity advice and assistance will help in building community resilience; it will reduce reliance on public sector bodies in the event of an emergency and enable Category 1 and 2 responders to focus their resources on the most vulnerable. It will also help improve links between Category 1 and 2 responders and the business community and voluntary sector, which are crucial to effective emergency management arrangements.Advice and assistance duty in context8.6. As Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1 illustrates, the business continuity advice and assistance duty is closely related to other duties in the Act, and should not be seen as a stand-alone duty. Developing and exercising emergency plans may require close liaison with organisations that carry out commercial or voluntary activities - for example in the preparation of city centre evacuation plans. There is a clear link between this work and the duty to give BCM advice and assistance to businesses, in many ways, it is a logical extension of this work.8.7. In fulfilling their duty to assess risks in their area and collaborate in the preparation of the Community Risk Register, local authorities will have a good overview of the risk profile in an area. Furthermore, emergency planning work - and co-operation with other Category 1 and 2 responders through Local Resilience Forums (LRF’s) - will leave local authorities well-sighted on the arrangements that are in place to deal with emergencies (see Chapters 2 and 4).8.8. There is also a strong relationship with the warning and informing duty (see Chapter 7). This requires Category 1 responders to publish aspects of risk assessments and contingency plans, and to maintain arrangements to issue advice, information and warnings in the event of an emergency. The section 4 duty builds on this work, by requiring local authorities to provide information, advice and assistance targeted at organisations that carry out commercial activities and voluntary activities.PAGE 5
Box 8.1: Further advice and informationGeneric advice and assistance8.9. The Regulations specify that local authorities have a duty to provide generic advice and assistance to the business community at large 2 ; but its duty regarding voluntary organisations is to provide advice and assistance to those organisations it considers appropriate and in a way it considers appropriate.38.10. While the Act imposes a duty on local authorities to offer advice and assistance, it does not impose a corresponding obligation on those organisations to act upon it.8.11. In complying with this duty, local authorities must demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to promote BCM advice in their areas. This will involve developing a strategy that:o identifies what organisations need to know;o selects appropriate means of delivery; ando targets the message at its audience.[See the case studies at Box 8.3 for examples of how some local authorities have undertaken this.]
2 regulation 39(3)(a)3 regulation 40(2) and 40(3)
PAGE 6
8.12. As a result of local authorities’ generic awareness-raising work, individual firms may turn to the local authority for specific advice and assistance in relation to BCM. The Regulations permit local authorities to provide specific BCM services to organisations or groups of organisations, but do not oblige them to do so.48.13. Local authority officials can undertake this type of work themselves if they have the experience and competence to do so. Local authorities can work with individual organisations or other local authorities to establish the nature of the risks they face and the steps they can take to manage these risks. This might include, for example:o assistance with risk assessment;o provision of information and advice about local civil protection arrangements;o support in the development and validation of plans.8.14. With local authorities wishing to ensure value-for-money, it is reasonable that this applies in the area of promoting business continuity. Since the duty to advise and assist was introduced, local authorities, working in conjunction with partners such as police and fire services, have produced some good work that has made significant steps in building resilience in their communities. The result is that we now have a body of knowledge and experience within local authorities that can be used by others to discharge this duty in a cost effective way that has delivered demonstrably greater uptake.Signposting third party advice8.15. Alternatively, the local authority may give advice and assistance to individual organisations to facilitate the engagement of a business continuity consultant, who may be better placed to provide the support required. However, undertaking thiswork is discretionary, and is not a requirement of the regulations.5

PAGE 7
8.16. Outside large organisations, most of the people responsible for business continuity are not professionals, and may require guidance when purchasing business continuity advice, services or facilities.8.17. Where it chooses to go down this path, the local authority must remain impartial and take steps to ensure firms are referred to practitioners that have8.1. 
the competence and experience to advise them.6 certain circumstances, give rise to legal challenge.Definition of an emergency
Failure to do so could, in
8.18. BCM arrangements can be put in place to manage the risks associated with the full range of business interruptions, which could comprise anything from minor supplier or technology failure through to the potentially catastrophic effects of terrorism or natural disaster. BCM is a flexible framework designed to help organisations develop resilience to the full spectrum of events. However, the Act imposes a duty on local authorities to give advice and assistance to commercial and voluntary organisations on developing arrangements to deal with a much narrower range of disruptive challenges.8.19. The duty applies only to those events or situations defined as an emergency in the Act.7 It does not extend to the wider range of day-to-day disruptions which can threaten the smooth running - or even the very existence - of an organisation. The Act does not require local authorities to give advice and assistance in managing risks that are purely internal to the organisation (e.g. technical, commercial or financial aspects of running the organisation). Nor does it require local authorities to give advice on dealing with smaller-scale incidents (e.g. minor fires or theft).6 regulations 39(4) and 40(4)7 S.1
8.20. An emergency is likely to affect a number of organisations, which may in turn threaten to seriously disrupt the effective functioning of the community at large. Advice and assistance to the business and voluntary sector community at large should therefore focus on generic disruptions that affect a significant part of the community. In this respect, the BCM duty will enhance community resilience by encouraging a local business climate able to withstand the disruptions caused by an emergency.8.21. A key objective of the BCM duty is to help organisations to link in with practical emergency planning arrangements put in place by Category 1 responders. Local authorities will be particularly well placed to give advice and assistance to organisations in preparing for events or situations whose scale and impact require assessments of risk to be made and emergency plans to be prepared by Category 1 responders.8.22. However, organisations that recognise the value of BCM planning for emergencies are unlikely to confine their forward thinking to this type of risk only.Audience8.23. A key objective of the BCM advice and assistance duty under the Act is to minimise the economic impact of emergencies on the local community. It delivers this by requiring local authorities to encourage greater preparedness among organisations that carry out commercial activities, and providing advice and assistance in improving their resilience.PAGE 9
8.24. Commercial organisations are those private sector businesses operating for a profit.Charities are, by definition, voluntary organisations which carry out their activities on a ‘not for profit basis’. However, some charities have separate trading arms, and companies operating under these are classified as commercial organisations, whereas a ‘charity shop’, operated by the charity itself, is defined as a voluntary organisation. Building societies and credit unions carry out commercial activities, and although not privately owned, operate as a business and generate financial benefits for their members.8.25. The Regulations state that the duty to provide BCM advice and assistance only applies to businesses carrying on commercial activities in the local authority area.8 The duty will also extend to activities that operate in the area on a non-permanent basis e.g. music festivals or major construction projects. In many cases, the local authority will be aware of the presence of such activity in its area, for example through planning consents for construction projects, or through the local authority/emergency services Safety Advisory Groups set up to give advice and guidance to event organisers.8.26. The Act also requires local authorities to give advice and assistance to voluntary organisations in their communities, many of whom will not undertake commercial8.1. 
activities.9
Voluntary organisations play a critical role in local civil protection
arrangements; they also deliver a wide range of services that are crucial to the effective functioning of communities (e.g. providing advice, social care, cultural and spiritual services). Demands on their services are likely to increase in the event of an emergency, and, if they are unable to continue functioning, this could exacerbate its effects.8.27. Providing business continuity advice to voluntary organisations will help build the resilience of the wider community, and help limit the impact of emergencies on its ability to function effectively.8 regulation 39(2)9 s.4
8.28. However, the voluntary sector is large and diverse, and not all voluntary organisations would want - or indeed benefit from - business continuity advice. A large number of voluntary organisations, for example, do not employ staff or maintain premises. Given the large number of voluntary bodies (c. 600,000) - and the difficulty of reaching out to some of them - it is unrealistic to expect local authorities to proactively provide (even generic) advice and assistance to them all.8.29. The underlying principles of BCM are common to all organisations. In many instances- particularly where messages are made publicly available via websites - the costs to the local authority of extending their advice to all voluntary organisations will be minimal.8.30. However, when deciding how to prioritise when taking forward a proactive programme of advice and assistance, local authorities may need to take decisions about which voluntary organisations to approach, and where to target resources.8.31. The Regulations therefore permit a local authority itself to determine its8.1. 
target audience within the voluntary sector.10
The Regulations provide
that, in so doing, local authorities should have regard to a range offactors,11 including:o		Role in relation to emergencies: A large number of voluntary organisations play a direct role in preventing or responding to emergencies. In order to help others, they will need to be able to keep themselves operating in the event of an emergency.
10 regulation 40(2), s.411 regulation 40(5)
PAGE 11
o Contribution to the effective functioning of the community: In the event of an emergency, some organisations will be critical to the health and welfare of communities.o Economic importance: Staff numbers and turnover will also be an important consideration in determining target audiences. These will give an indication of an organisation’s importance to the local economy, and the likely value of business continuity planning adding value to an organisation.o Geography: It would not generally be appropriate for a local authority to give BCM advice to a voluntary organisation which does not carry out activities in the area for which the local authorityis responsible.Charging
8.32. 8.33. 12 regulation 44
The Regulations permit local authorities to make a charge for business continuity advice and assistance provided on request, where this is appropriate, but do not oblige them to do so.12It is unlikely that local authorities will be able to charge for promotional materials or awareness-raising materials supplied, which in many cases will not have been requested. However, local authorities may wish to make a charge for a number of activities including:o attendance at local authority organised events;o membership of business continuity forums;o provision of specific information (e.g. aspects of risk assessments);o provision of advice on an ad hoc basis (e.g. development or review of firms’ own plans); ando provision of an established BCM service.o 
8.34. The Regulations also provide that local authorities may only charge for BCM advice and assistance on a cost-recovery basis.13 Local authorities may charge for the full cost of all the resources used in carrying out activities for which a charge is to be made, and a reasonable share of any research or documentation that underpins this service. The regulations do not permit local authorities to seek to make a profit from activities in this area.8.35. Further guidance on charging policy can be found in the HM Treasury Fees and Charges Guide (http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk); however, local authorities will also want to consider the impact of their charging policy on the take-up of their advice and assistance.Risk assessment8.36. The BCM programme should reflect the risk profile of the area. When developing a BCM promotion strategy and materials, the officer responsible should ask: What possible disruptions do organisations need to know about? What impacts might they have? Are there any locations or firms that are particularly vulnerable?8.37. The Regulations require local authorities to “take into account” the Community Risk Register (CRR) agreed by the Local Resilience Forum (LRF) when developinga business continuity promotion programme.14	It may also be necessary toconsider risks outside the area that could impact upon businesses in a local authority area (e.g. major chemical plant in a neighbouring area), hence the requirement to have regard to “any relevant risk register”.13 regulation 4414 regulation 38
Developing collaborative arrangementsCollaboration with other local authorities8.38. The duty to provide advice and assistance in relation to BCM falls on all local authorities. The Regulations permit local authorities to enter into collaborative arrangements with other Category 1 or 2 responders (e.g. a Fire and Rescue Authority) in delivering the duty. 158.39. There are a number of options open to authorities in deciding how best to discharge their responsibility. This permissive approach gives local authorities the flexibility to decide how to make the best use of the skills, expertise, networks and resources available in an area. Working collaboratively could help ensure that efforts are co-ordinated and that economies of scale are achieved. There are a number of case studies with contacts contained in this guidance, at Box 8.3, which detail some of the ways that local authorities have discharged this duty in a cost effective and beneficial way to local businesses. This has been demonstrated by a measurable increase in website activity and engagement.8.40. However, it remains the responsibility of each authority to ensure that the programme is delivered effectively, and its statutory duties are fulfilled. Whichever option - or mixture of options - is chosen, each authority should ensure that:o roles and responsibilities are clear;o clear review and evaluation mechanisms are in place;o the programme adequately reflects the diverse business needs and risk profile within an LRF area; ando elected members and senior officers are brought into the processwhere necessary.15 regulations 41(3) and 41(4)
Box 8.2: Delivering BCM in partnershipBusiness continuity management and promotion has become an integral part of the Local Resilience Forum structure within the Northumbria area. Responsibility for promotion lies with the five councils of Tyne and Wear and Northumberland Emergency Planning Department and is discharged by the Tyne and Wear Emergency Planning Unit who coordinates activity on behalf of the Tyne and Wear Councils. The Business Continuity Management Promotion Strategy is focused on maximising business resilience within the Northumbria LRF by facilitating the coordination of promotional materials and events.On a day to day basis, responsibility includes the Tyne and Wear Emergency Planning Unit providing a comprehensive resilience planning service to all five councils in the Tyne and Wear area as well as work on specific business continuity initiatives. This includes:o Provision of advice and guidance.o Training of staff earmarked with business continuity roles within procurement.o Speaking at seminars.o Facilitating workshops.o Supporting internal business promotion days.Promotional aspects have included the recent Business Continuity Conference (March 2010) and current involvement includes the organising and management of business continuity Information events which will be taking place during Business Continuity Awareness week in March 2011.
8.41. Delegation, or the appointment of a lead authority, does not absolve the local authority of the duty, but merely transforms the mode of delivery. The local authority remains under a legal duty to ensure the programme is delivered, even when a third party is contracted to complete the work.Partnership working in BCM promotiono Separate programmes: Local authorities deliver BCM programmes separately, while ensuring the coherence of the message and means of delivery.o Delegation: All or some local authorities in an LRF area delegate the duty to a single authority, which then delivers the duty on their behalf. Delegation can be to any Category 1 or 2 responder not just to a local authority.o Joint working: This would involve a single programme being delivered jointly by a number of local authorities.o Appointing a “lead authority”: This involves giving one or more partner authorities a leading role within the delivery of the programme, with other authorities fulfilling a lesser, supporting role. The lead authority could, for example, co-ordinate the content and production of promotional material for othersto deliver.
Co-ordination of BCM promotion programmes8.42. The Regulations require local authorities within an LRF area to co-operate with each other when performing their duties under section 4 of the Act1.6 The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that local authorities within an LRF area deliver a coherent programme of advice and assistance to organisations undertaking commercial activities in their communities.8.43. This co-operation may take place bilaterally or within a single forum. Whatever form this co-operation takes, authorities will need to take steps to ensure that:o the message they are giving out is consistent;o the means of delivery are co-ordinated where appropriate;o external partners are not unduly burdened; ando lessons are identified and learned and best practice is shared.8.44. The BCM promotion programme in an LRF area should be driven by the needs of local organisations, not local authorities’ administrative boundaries. Organisations in an LRF area will often operate across local authority boundaries, hence the importance of delivering a co-ordinated message with promotional or awareness- raising work.8.45. Local authorities will also want to consider the need to adopt a coherent approach to the provision of specific advice and assistance where this is requested.8.1.

The duty to provide advice and assistance in relation to BCM falls on local authorities, but this does not mean that other Category 1 responders should not support these programmes.8.47. A number of other Category 1 responders are already engaged in providing BCM advice. This work should be supported and encouraged by local authorities as part of the wider promotion programme under the Act.8.48. The Regulations require local authorities to have regard to the business continuity assistance work other Category 1 responders are doing in the community.17 In practice, this means that local authorities are required to develop an awareness of the business continuity work other Category 1 responders undertake with organisations, and consider the implications of this work for their own business continuity advice and assistance programmes.8.49. This will help local authorities to ensure that programmes complement other work.Local authorities should take steps to ensure that their BCM advice and assistance programmes dovetail with work undertaken by other Category 1 responders, that synergies are exploited, and that they work collaboratively where possible. The Regulations additionally provide that local authorities need not unnecessarily duplicate the work done by other responders with local organisations.1817 regulation 43(1)18 regulation 43(1)(b)
8.50. Furthermore, BCM awareness material will address public sector response arrangements and risk profiles, which will require the collaboration of other Category 1 responders. It is, therefore, important that local authorities have access to the right information and advice to inform their promotion strategies, and that the assumptions they make about other Category 1 responders’ response arrangements are accurate. The Regulations impose a duty on all Category 1 and 2 responders to co-operate and share information on request pursuant to local authorities’ duties under section 4 of the Act.198.51. This co-operation may take place bilaterally, as required, or via a subgroup of the LRF.Other Category 1 Responders’ work with commercial organisations

Crime Their work is co-ordinated by the National Counter Terrorism and Security Office (NACTSO), which published the Expecting the Unexpected document (https://vsat.nactso.gov.uk/SiteCollection Documents/OurServices/expecting-the-unexpected.pdf) in conjunction with London First and the Business Continuity Institute. CTSAs can be contacted via local police headquarters.o		Advice on emergency response procedures: Police services seek to raise awareness among local businesses about emergencyresponse procedures (e.g. evacuation procedures, cordoning in the event of an incident). Project ARGUS (http://www.nactso. gov.uk/OurServices/Argus.aspx) is a NACTSO initiative, which takes businesses through a simulated terrorist attack and identifies prevention, handling and recovery measures. Project Griffin (http://www.projectgriffin.org.uk/) was developed by the City of London Police as a joint venture between the City and Metropolitan police forces. Its remit was to advise large public and private sector organisations on security, counter-terrorism and crime prevention issues. It is increasingly being adopted by other police forces.Fire AuthoritiesSince 1947, fire authorities have been under a duty to provide, on request, information about fire prevention and mitigation. The Fire and Rescue Service Act 2004 conferred a new duty on fire authorities to make provision for actively promoting fire safety within their area. This involves the provision of advice and assistance to local businesses. They work with occupiers/owners in the business community to offer advice over a broad range of topics - proactively and on request.
This work will be undertaken in different ways according to the priorities in the area.In Hereford and Worcester, specialist Fire Safety Inspecting Officers receive technical training so that they can offer advice and assistance to commercial organisations on issues such as:o arson reduction;o business continuity; ando community fire safety.Fire-fighters reinforce this proactive approach to fire prevention by taking forward aspects of this approach in their day-to-day work. They may work closely with other enforcement agencies and bodies providing business continuity advice to explore opportunities for partnership working.Maritime and Coastguard AgencyThe Maritime and Coastguard Agency is committed to preventing loss of life, continuously improving maritime safety, and protecting the marine environment. Various aspects of this work involve BCM promotion.In addition to enforcing contingency planning requirements, the Agency undertakes a range of educational initiatives with the shipping, fishing, and offshore oil and gas industries, as well as with those who visit the sea or coast for leisure. Further information can be found at: http:// www.dft.gov.uk/mca/.
8.52. Local authorities must observe the limits on sharing sensitive information set out in the Regulations when taking forward their programme of advice and assistance. Local authorities may have access to - or be asked for - personal data or information that relates to national security or public safety. Even where this would assist the local authority in its BCM advice and assistance work, this information should not be disclosed, unless appropriate consent has been obtained or the public interest in disclosure outweighs the interests of the organisation or individual concerned. The same applies to commercially sensitive information, which must also be treated appropriately. Chapter 3 sets out in more detail the limits on dealing with sensitive information. [See also case studies 3 and 5 in Box 8.3]How the Act and the regulations apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern IrelandScotland8.53. The Regulations made by the Minister which relate to the promotion of business continuity do not apply to local authorities in Scotland. The Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers make provision as to how local authorities in Scotland should exercise their duty to provide advice and assistance in relation to business continuity.Wales8.54. The Act and the Regulations apply in Wales in the same way as they apply in England.8.1. 
Northern Ireland8.55. The duty to provide advice and assistance to business and voluntary organisations in relation to business continuity does not apply to local authorities in Northern Ireland.8.56. This section outlines how the Government believes the duties described may best be carried out. It describes good practice. Category 1 responders must have regard to this guidance.20Why should organisations put BC plans in place?8.57. Whilst the duty to promote BC is founded on the wider contribution to national resilience, to use this reason as a way to encourage businesses to take up business continuity may not encourage businesses to take that step and make that investment.8.58. For the majority of commercial businesses, any decision to adopt a system or activity will focus on ‘business benefits’. It is therefore imperative that when promoting business continuity, the arguments used resonate with those responsible for making these decisions. These should promote the financial benefits that can be accrued by:o conducting a business impact analysis to evaluate the critical activities to a business (e.g. the processes for producing and selling those products that have the highest profit margin);o demonstrating processes in place to deal with disruption to existing and potential new customers;20 s.4(8)(b)
o reduction of costly downtime, through alternative arrangements such as dual-sourcing and contingency measures;o reduction in insurance premiums for policies such as ‘business disruption’ when demonstrating resilience measures;o the ability to retain, and possibly gain new contracts and customers through being able to deliver when others can’t.8.59. The following information will be useful to local businesses in assessing the need to develop business continuity plans:o the kinds of disruption which could occur, ando the impacts they may have (e.g. loss of utilities or access to premises);o the arrangements that Category 1 responders have in place to assess the risk of, prepare for, respond to and recover fromemergencies, and their implications for the business community (e.g. evacuation or recovery plans);o the steps individual organisations can take to prepare for, or mitigate the effects of, an emergency (e.g. implement BCM); ando sources of warnings, information and advice in the event of an emergency.8.60. Levels of BCM awareness and activity will vary considerably between organisations.In some cases the challenge will be to get BCM on the agenda, and in others the challenge will be to sell the concept or help organisations already doing BCM to refine their plans.
Delivering a programme of advice and assistance / discharging the duty8.61. Since 2005, local authorities have developed various means of discharging the duty: providing a service to the communities and contributing to national resilience.  Some believe they have achieved real value in this area.  Some of these are included as case studies at Box 8.3. They have been generously provided by local authorities, whose contact details can be found at the foot of each case study.8.62. Practical advice in delivering the duty to provide business continuity advice and assistance is set out below.
In addition to specific advice on business continuity, a website can be used to direct businesses to other sources of information about civil protection issues, including the CRR and other Category 1 and 2 responders’ sites and to reference other sites offering guidance on the development of business continuity arrangements.Press releasesArticles in appropriate publications can raise awareness of business continuity issues, or to direct readers to relevant materials. Local authorities publishing an annual business or voluntary sector directory can use them to publicise the message. References in publications issued by partner organisations (e.g. business or social action representative groups) can also be useful.MailingsLocal authorities have various means, e.g. business rate letters, of disseminating guidance to the business and voluntary sector, this might include existing reference materials on BCM, available from a wide range of sources, including the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Business Continuity Institute.Participation in seminars/eventsExisting events/seminars targeted at businesses or the voluntary sector, whether organised by the Local Authority Economic Development Department or other local partners, can be used to communicate the
message on BCM promotion and to publicise sources of information on BCM, either provided by the local authority or by a third party.Facilitating or hosting eventsLocal authorities may choose, individually or in collaboration with others, to organise their own BCM events, e.g. regional or local business continuity fairs or seminars. A seminar or fair could be used to launch a new BCM forum. The costs incurred by local authorities might be met by charging a small attendance fee, inviting firms to sponsor such events, or by seeking collaboration from business or voluntary sector representative bodies. (See Box 8.2 for a short case study of similar activity undertaken by Tyne and Wear Emergency Planning Unit.)Establishing a business continuity forumThe formation of business continuity forums, facilitated by local authorities, can encourage members of the business community to participate. These forums can promote business continuity management, and help to consolidate a local network, within which businesses can learn from each other and liaise with Category 1 and 2 responders.Local authorities and the emergency services are often already engaged with the business and voluntary sector communities, for example, in planning for evacuation in the face of a threat of flooding or terrorism or the fire prevention work undertaken by the Fire and Rescue Service. These links provide a strong basis for developing a business forum looking at BCM or emergency planning issues in the round. Forums can be used to strengthen the links between businesses and LRFs. (See also the case studies 2 and 5 in Box 8.3.)
Specific advice8.63. Whilst local authorities are more likely to achieve value for money through events and promotion activities that reach out to a wide audience, there is nothing to prevent the provision of specific advice as part of the method of discharging the duty. However, this is likely to be more time consuming and the following paragraphs should be noted.8.64. Whichever approach local authorities take to the provision of specific information and advice to businesses or voluntary organisations requesting further support, they should consider developing a documented policy statement, in order to manage the expectations of local organisations and ensure consistency and fairness.8.65. Local authorities should also be aware of professional liability issues when giving specific advice and assistance. In order to reduce the risk of claims of negligence or breach of contract, local authorities should:o only become involved in areas where they are competent and experienced enough to give advice and assistance;o be clear about the status and limits of advice;o clearly flag up areas of uncertainty or assumptions that have been made; ando consider the use of disclaimers where appropriate.8.66. However, liability issues should not deter local authorities from giving detailed advice and assistance. If managed correctly, the risk of legal challenge is limited, and far outweighed by the demand from organisations for support, and the possible benefits in terms of community resilience.8.1. 
Referring organisations to a third party8.67. The local authority should avoid giving definitive recommendations, or endorsing individual consultants. Its role is to direct firms to organisations that could assist them, and suggest the criteria for selecting a service provider. These could include:o professional qualifications/certification;o membership of a professional organisation;o experience in relevant aspects of BCM;o track record of completing similar tasks; ando adequate professional indemnity insurance.8.68. The Business Continuity Institute (BCI) (http://www.thebci.org) provides a certification scheme for business continuity professionals. It publishes a list of consultants it deems to be experienced, qualified and competent in particular areas, and operates a code of practice for members. The Continuity Forum also provides a service designed to help connect consultants with clients: Consultancy Signpost lists individuals and organisations who provide consultancy services covering business continuity and its related disciplines. It is publicly available via the front page of the Continuity Forum’s website http://www.continuityforum.org. The BCI and the Chartered Management Institute are useful sources of advice on commissioning consultants. The local authority can also facilitate the sharing of feedback on consultants by maintaining records of the organisations who have sought its advice about the engagement of a third party.8.69. Nonetheless, the local authority will need to make it clear to firms that the choice of consultant is their sole responsibility, and that the local authority shall not be liable for any damage or loss suffered as a result.8.1. 
BCM advice to the community and the LRF process8.70. The arrangements for multi-agency co-operation established by the Act will establish a framework for delivering joined-up and effective civil protection. BCM promotion is an integral part of the wider package of civil protection activity, and requires multi-agency co-operation and information-sharing to be effective.8.71. Local authorities will want to consider how they use this wider framework to deliver the co-ordination and buy-in required for effective BCM advice and assistance activity. Much can be achieved through informal working-level contact, but there may be some merit in formalising this co-operation. This could take the form of:o regular discussions at working-level liaison groups;o establishing a community resilience subgroup of the LRF; oro discussion at LRF meetings.8.72. The approach taken will depend, in large part, on the nature of the local authorities’ programmes, the means used to deliver the message, and the extent of the involvement of other agencies in the process. It is good practice for the full LRF to be given a chance to discuss BCM promotion work once each year.Identifying and engaging other external partners8.73. Local authorities should consider engaging partner organisations in the process of providing information, advice and assistance to organisations that carry on commercial activities and to voluntary organisations. This should prove useful in communicating with firms and gaining their buy-in, providing support in organising events or forums, and as a source of BCM expertise.8.1. 
Figure 8.1: Network of BCM promotion partnersRepresentative groups   Local AuthoritiesAgenda groups8.74. Figure 8.1 shows a range of organisations in both the public and private sectors that may be willing to collaborate with local authorities in this work. These are:o Within local authorities: Local authorities themselves have established links with the business community, which can be utilised when promoting BCM (e.g. Economic Development Units, City Centre Management Units and Community Safety Teams). Local authorities also have close links with voluntary organisations, which are often engaged as partners in service delivery.o Representative groups: There are a number of groups that represent the business community or sections of it (e.g. Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, and Federation of Small Businesses). Councils for Voluntary Service (CVS) are voluntary organisations which are set up, owned and run by local groups to support, promote and develop local voluntary and community action. CVS support their members by providing them with a range of serviceso 
and by acting as a voice for the local voluntary and community sector.They provide a useful way to identify the local voluntary sector community. There is a CVS working in almost every district and city in England, and they usually work within the same geographical boundaries as the local authority. To find your local CVS visit http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/o Education bodies: Higher education institutions and collegesof further education may be effective partners in the promotion of BCM through their business courses. A number of higher education institutions also offer BCM qualification courses which may be useful to local authorities seeking to develop their competence in this area.o Professional bodies: There are a number of organisations that exist to promote the take-up and standards of business continuity in the business community, including the Business Continuity Institute andContinuity Forum. There are also professional bodies or institutes with a wider remit - including the Chartered Institute of Management andBritish Institute of Facilities Management - which can provide a way into the business community in an area.o Agenda groups: There are a range of bodies that can act as a conduit for BCM promotion work (e.g. Local Strategic Partnerships, Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships).o Commercial BCM providers: Commercial organisations providing a range of BCM services may be willing to sponsor business continuity initiatives or events.o Individual businesses: Experience has shown that gaining the support of larger firms is important in taking forward a BCM promotion programme. Larger firms are more likely to be familiar with the discipline of BCM, and may already have established relationships with Category 1 and 2 responders. They may provide useful support in establishing business continuity seminars and companies - or large 
 well-established voluntary bodies - in their area. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are also crucial to the UK forums, and give assistance in raising the profile of BCM within the business community (e.g. through supply-chain leadership, membership ofassociations). Professional services firms (e.g. banks, accountants) may be willing to distribute information through their websites.(See case studies 3 and 5 in Box 8.3.)Targeting adviceSize of organisations8.75. BCM arrangements are crucial to the sustainability of all organisations. Local authorities should not assume that business continuity is well established in the large national or multi-national companies - or large well-established voluntary bodies - in their area. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are also crucial to the UK economy, accounting for some 99.9% of the UK’s 4.8 million businesses. They account for 59.8% of the number in employment in the private sector and generate 49 per cent of private sector turnover. In total, turnover in SMEs is estimated to be£1.589 billion (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, October 2010 http:// www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/statistics/docs/b/bpe_2010_stats_release.pdf).8.76. Local authorities should ensure that materials used are appropriate to the needs of businesses, which may vary considerably. While the underpinning principles remain the same, the approach taken when approaching a small owner-managed firm will be different to that taken with a large, well-established firm. Local authorities will need to be proactive in engaging the SME community, and ensure that materials are pitched at the right level.8.1. 
8.77. It may be helpful to think of the business community in terms of the following definitions used by the Department for Business Industry and Skills:o Micro firm: 0-9 employeeso Small firm: 10-49 employeeso Medium firm: 50-249 employeeso Large firm: Over 250 employees8.78. Where it is not possible to engage smaller businesses directly in a community resilience initiative, it may be possible to include them through a variety of umbrella groups that can disseminate information and advice. This can be achieved through groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, Business Link, The Federation of Small Businesses and Local Retail Initiatives. Voluntary organisations can be reached through local Voluntary Service Councils, Social Councils, Volunteer Bureaux and other local umbrella bodies. (See case studies 4, 5 and 6 in Box 8.3.)Added value8.79. Local authorities may wish to focus on organisations that are well placed to give support to the programme by helping to raise awareness or by offering practical support (e.g. venues). Local authorities may also wish to target organisations that are able to provide help or resources to other organisations or Category 1 responders in the event of an emergency, or organisations whose activities are crucial to the effective functioning of the wider community (e.g. food suppliers).8.1. 
Maintaining a BCM advice and assistance programme8.80. In order to ensure that they continue to fulfil the requirements of the business continuity advice and assistance duty, local authorities will wish to undertake a continuous cycle of assessing the content and delivery of the promotion programme against the requirements of the legislation, assessments of risk, needs of the audience, and resources and support mechanisms available. This is likely to involve:o Developing objectives and message:ï Clear objectives should be established in consultation with partners in the LRF, and the message and target audience should be defined with reference to the CRR. Are proposed approaches coherent and will they be effective?o Reviewing promotion materials:ï There is a wide range of existing materials illustrating the importance of BCM and how to develop businesscontinuity arrangements. Is there a need to develop further materials tailored to local circumstances? And what form might these take (e.g. printed, web-based, etc)o Reviewing the means of delivery:ï Choose means of delivery in the light of available resources and support from partners. Publicise events and services offered, and publicise any charging policy.ï 
o Delivery:ï The case studies contained in this chapter will give authorities guidance on ways in which the duty is delivered in other areas. The details of those responsible can be found at the end of the individual case studies and should be contacted with any questions?o Evaluate and review programme:ï Gathering feedback along the way is a useful way to judge if the programme met its stated objectives? Has feedback been positive? How could it be improved or extended? What lessons can be learned from experience elsewhere inthe country?Box 8.3: Business continuity advice and assistance to business and the voluntary sector: Case studies
BackgroundIn May 2008, a decision was taken by the Planning and Environment Committee to focus on business continuity; in particular, how small to medium size enterprises and charities could best cope with emergency situations both within their own company and on a wider scale.A business continuity sub-committee was formed involving representatives from Woking and Surrey Chambers of Commerce, local businesses, Woking Borough Council, and Surrey County Council. The sub-committee provided a steer on developing a strategy and this led to a series of meetings, discussions and presentations on how this could best be delivered to local business.By early 2009, a draft proposal was in place to develop a website to act as a business continuity hub in order to help local businesses understand the basic principles of BCM together with signposting them to find additional information if required. Woking Borough Council and Surrey County Council agreed to part fund this, with the Surrey Local Resilience Forum agreeing to co-sponsor the initiative and provide additional funding to develop the project.The sub-committee put out to tender and a company was short- listed and commissioned to deliver the website. The company has an innovative way of delivering the website using panoramic views summarising phases of the business continuity process, case studies featuring local business incidents and an interactive quiz.
ConclusionAlthough Surrey delivers business continuity advice through traditional methods such as leaflets, conferences and local forums, surreycontinuity helps promote other local initiatives such as Project ARGUS and GRIFFIN.Surreycontinuity has been kept simple and is able to be used by those with no previous experience of business continuity. This gives it the flexibility to target a generic audience within the community such as small to medium enterprises, independent care providers and schools, also reaching a global audience.Detailed weekly and monthly web traffic reports are providing useful in validating the success of the website. Although limited in determining the type and exact location of the organisation accessing the website, they do provide detail of number of hits, method of access and global location. The most popular part of the site is the case studies.The results have certainly raised the profile of the county; and the work of the Surrey Local Resilience Forum; and proved that engaging and working in partnership can deliver benefits to the local community.Kevin SmithDeputy Head of Emergency Management Chief Executive’s OfficeSurrey County Council Kingston upon Thames KT1 2DNTel: 0208 541 9160
Case Study 2 – Milton Keynes CouncilMilton Keynes Council is a unitary Council with approx 220,000 citizens. The concept of a Milton Keynes Business Resilience Forum (MKBRF) was initially proposed by Milton Keynes Council at the local BCI Forum in June 2006. It was seen to be the best way to promote BC to local businesses and encourage the involvement of local businesses. Following the first MKBRF event, an independent lead team was established consisting of, and chaired by, voluntary representatives from local businesses. The MKBRF was established to promote the benefits of effective business continuity by:o providing information and advice;o sharing experiences between members;o holding business continuity and incident management exercises;o sharing threat and opportunity data (horizon scanning);o provide informal mentoring;o create a networking opportunity for local organisations and BC practitioners; and,o providing mutual help and support.Currently the membership of the MKBRF stands at over 300 local organisations, predominantly from the Milton Keynes area, but several from further afield. There is also an active LinkedIn forum which does not require MKBRF registration.In addition to developing and facilitating events, Milton Keynes Council, in conjunction with the MKBRF, provides a website BC toolkit and an informal mentoring scheme. The website receives on average 1500 hits per month.
Analysis of feedback received following exercises and events, as well as key topics of the moment and market research carried out by the MKBRF lead team during 2010, drive the requirement for the next event. Attendees are also asked to suggest topics for future activities which ensures that the needs of the audience are consistently met.All events have been free of charge. Milton Keynes Council has been supportive of all events and gained sponsorship from businesses based in Milton Keynes to assist with the costs.Timeline of events

The most difficult hurdle to overcome is getting organisations to consider business continuity. Part of the County Council’s strategy is not to promote business continuity using ‘scare tactics’ but rather promote the benefits of practical and effective contingency planning. The County Council believes that good business continuity is good business.Furthermore, the County Council accepts that not everyone would be interested in, or understand, the relevance of BS25999 to their organisation, so decided against promoting the standard in its entirety. We do, however, actively promote its methodology and the benefits of adopting the Standard as good practice. As an organisation’s business continuity programme matures, with minimal effort it will become more aligned with the standard.The Council’s initial approach to promoting business continuity was linked into the embedded procurement and supply-chain processes. This enabled us to prioritise and assess the levels of resilience in place for key suppliers/providers and, if necessary, provide them with guidance, support and assistance so that they were able to meet the Council’s supplier requirements in terms of business continuity practice.Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland (LLR) have an active, Local Resilience Forum (LRF). In early 2010, the LRF established a business continuity subgroup – called the Business Continuity Practitioners Forum (BCF). This group, as part of its remit, aims to promote business continuity good practice across all business sectors in the LLR region.During Business Continuity Awareness week 2010, the BCF published a one-page supplement in some of the regions newspapers and their related websites which generated a substantial interest and response from the business community.
The BCF and County Council have combined their business continuity planning and exercise workshops and these have now been rolled out as a LRF initiative across the region. Separate planning and exercise workshops are run on a monthly basis. The BCF has –o strong links into all the regions Trading Standards teams as well as other business networks e.g. Federation of Small Businesses and Chamber of Commerce;o started to develop initiatives with its partners (police and fire) to further promote business continuity (e.g. Emergency Response Planning for Schools and Residential Care Providers); ando launched the LLR Business Continuity Working Group for businesses, regardless of sector and size, in the region. This free, one day workshop, introduced the business community to the LRF business continuity advisors who are available to assist organisations in developing their own practical resilience programmes. The working group will meet on a regular basis (every 8 weeks) to share and develop good practice amongst businesses across the region. The service is provided free of charge to all business sectors.The County Council and the LRF accept that the aims may not be achieved overnight, but remain optimistic that, over time, their approach will become embedded as one of the key support services offered in the LLR region.Officer to Contact:Mondy Holliday, Business Continuity Manager,Leicestershire County Council 0116 305 5400; businesscontinuity@leics.gov.uk
Case Study 4 – Cardiff CouncilCardiff Council has adopted a unique approach by attempting to embed business continuity promotion as a key strand of its EVAC Cardiff initiative. EVAC Cardiff is a multi-agency service which combines a number of statutory duties and national policing initiatives under one brand. The initiative was a finalist in the 2008 Wales Innovation Awards where it was commended for combining different strands of Cardiff’s resilience programme delivered by using clever technology and strong easily distinguishable branding.The business continuity element of EVAC Cardiff has been delivered in three specific ways, these are –o electronically via a BCM promotion website – The website has been developed to be eye catching and easy to navigate. The site delivers key messages using simple language with an emphasis on selling the positives rather than focusing on the negative reasons for undertaking this work. It uses different technologies such as video/flash and many downloadable templates and tools. It also links to other sites and a feedback questionnaire which also gathers important statistical data on which sectors and size of business are using the website: http://www.nonverba.com/admin/ cardiff/welcome.htmEVAC Warden training – The training is aimed at any business irrespective of their size or sector. It covers risks specific to Cardiff, how the scheme works and the importance of business continuity, signposting businesses to the promotion website for advice and guidance. Businesses also have the ability
of booking their staff on to EVAC warden training via the promotion website.Cardiff has developed its own Area Risk Register which is published on the website. The register has been developed by a multi-agency group and also co-opting specific sector specialists to ensure that the register reflects Cardiff’s issues and also to cross reference current plans are adequate enough.The Council managed to negotiate the site development as part of a deal it brokered for internal business continuity software. The only small costs incurred are when updates are required but these very small. Using technology also reduces the amount of officer time as businesses can `help themselves` to whatever resources they choose to use from the website. E-mail has been used to send promotional information to businesses in Cardiff by tapping in to distribution lists from the Council’s economic development department which has proven to be an effective and free way of raising awareness of the website.The strength of the brand locally has made it easier for Cardiff to get buy in from local businesses. The initiative is supported by all the emergency services and this has enhanced the Council’s relationship with partners and in particular the business community.Reaching every business in Cardiff is a challenge and indeed not all businesses have access to the internet in order to benefit from the resources on the website. SMEs are more difficult to engage for a variety of reasons but the Council is always looking to`piggy back` onto other local initiatives as an opportunity to promote the key messages.Contact:Cardiff Emergency Management UnitTel: 02920 871838 email: emergencymanagement@cardiff.gov.uk
Case Study 5 – Manchester City CouncilManchester’s partnership approach to delivering Business Continuity Advice and AssistanceManchester City Council delivers its business continuity advice and assistance programme via the Manchester Business Continuity Forum (MBCF), which has a membership or nearly 400 organisations. The Council has provided resources (staffing and financial) to support the MBCF’s work programme. It remains an equal partner with the other MBCF member organisations. The MBCF is increasing the resilience of Manchester based organisations, through cross-sector collaboration and partnership working. It aims to:o improve the resilience of Manchester’s communities, businesses and voluntary organisations; encouraging them to respond effectively to internal or external threats of disruption, thereby lessening the economic and social impact of emergencies and speeding up the subsequent recovery; ando contribute to Manchester’s prominence as a leadingeconomic hub by showcasing its ongoing commitment to building safe, sustainable and resilient communities by continually increasing the resilience of the city.MBCF has a number of notable features:o activities and priorities for the MBCF are always member coordinated, led and driveno 
o recognition of the part every organisation has to playin ensuring Manchester has ‘Business Continuity Whatever the Disruption’o firm commitment to building on and facilitating the sharing of BCM knowledge and expertise already present in Manchestero commitment to partnership with leading professional bodies, academia and complementary networkso real opportunities for a wide range of organisationsto learn from each other, share good practice and experience and opportunities to work together to increase the resilience of Manchestero willingness to share the learning and successes of MBCF outside of Manchester – regionally, nationally and internationally.The MBCF’s accountability to its members is demonstrated by the existence of a Steering Group, which consists of member organisations working to terms of reference and overseeing the delivery of a formal work plan for MBCF.To help reflect the needs of the City and the ability to provide a wide range of general and specific business continuity advice and guidance, the Steering Group is made up of representatives from a variety of organisations and subject matter experts in the field of resilience. Current Steering Group representation includes senior representation from large blue chip companies, Third Sector organisations, business networks, including the Chamber of Commerce, universities, and the emergency services.
Crucially, Manchester City Council has facilitated the creation of a clear and individual identity for the MBCF to ensure that it is an independent and successful initiative, rather than being identified as a city council project. The membership reflects the diversity of the organisations within the city.MBCF is dedicated to achieving tangible outcomes including regular educational and awareness seminars, mentorship programme, networking events, scenario based testing and exercise opportunities, publications and consultation activities some of which are described below:Buddy SchemeThe MBCF is particularly keen to support small and medium enterprises in the city, as well as third sector organisations, by the creation of a mentorship programme. The MBCF Buddy Scheme has been designed so that representatives from organisations with well- developed business continuity arrangements can ‘buddy up’ with representatives from organisations that would benefit from extra support in this area.MBCF Network groupThe idea behind the MBCF Network Group is to provide an informal space for MBCF members to discuss ‘BCM in action’ with a very practical focus to help members help each other, by sharing good practice, experience and lessons learned from BCM incidents.
Events and seminarsThe MBCF has hosted a variety of events, including a large launch event, which helped shape the direction of the Forum’s activities based on direct feedback. Most of the events are aimed at any member of the Forum; however ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ was aimed at people from Third Sector organisations specifically, designed to give an introduction to business continuity management. There are plans to hold the event as an annual initiative. In addition to the large scale events, there have been a number of smaller breakfast seminars, focusing on topical issues such as Pandemic Flu preparedness and Counter Terrorism issues.MBCF publishingThe MBCF has created on-line support, which includes signposting to existing good practice for BCM as well as creating templates and other ‘how-to’ guides.City wide exerciseIn late summer 2010, the MBCF ran the city’s first public-private collaborative exercise, which aimed to exemplify best practice in collaborative exercising. Several businesses participated with representation from emergency services, the council and Manchester University. The participants explored how their various business groups would react individually, collectively and in partnership.This was one of the first such exercising initiatives in the UK. The objective was to see how the main parties would react to an incident. The exercise was not an emergency services exercise but rather a simultaneous exercise for a large number of major employers and significant companies within the Manchester City Centre area. It ensured that all parties’ responses and plans were exercised as they would be in reality.

“We needed to overcome the common attitude that insurance companies would take care of any disasters,” said Ingrid. “What businesses often didn’t consider was, if their business had to temporarily close due to a disaster, would they find an alternative supplier, would they lose customers, and would they lose staff? These are the themes that the new training aims to develop.”Such issues are particularly important in the Shetland Islands, which has seen more than its share of commercially damaging incidents in recent years, from storms to maritime disasters. Working closely with the consultants, the Council recognised the vulnerability of the islands to natural and man-made catastrophes, and was keen to make this factor a key component of the online campaign.The course uses a series of tailor-made online video and audio presentations to help business owners understand the practical relevance of BC to their businesses and to their local environment. As the presentations are online, users can view them at their own pace, and then complete a workbook and a series of contingency checklists to help them develop their own BC plan.The course begins with a ‘newsreader’ highlighting some of the perils of island life and of coastal climates. The checklists use specific examples of local industries. For instance, the section covering asset protection cites creel boats and lobster pots as key assets to protect. And the island’s unique logistical challenges are also explored, addressing the potential absence of the ferry service in times of severe weather and rough seas.
For Ingrid, this practical, local focus, and the ability for users to dip in and out at their own pace, is key to overcoming business apathy when faced with generic BC information, or one-off seminars, “The website is very practical, easy to work through, and means people can have a full contingency plan of their own within a matter of hours. It’s short, sharp and, above all, specifically relates to the businesses and challenges we have here on the islands.”After the initial start-up costs, the website has proved to be a cost-effective way for the Council to meet it business continuity responsibilities – a statutory duty of all local authorities.“Running seminars can be quite expensive, especially if you don’t get many people attending,” explained Ingrid. “Now the website’s active, it is pretty much self-sustaining and won’t need much updating. We’re going to further address business continuity at the Shetland Business Gateway for new businesses, and we’re also linking it to the Shetland Emergency Planning Forum – so it all forms part of a rolling programme.”Feedback has so far been excellent for the www.shetlandcontinuity.co.uk website. Since its launch in November 2010, take-up has exceeded expectations and many users have contacted the council requesting experts to come and talk to them about other benefits of emergency planning.For further details contact:Ingrid GallEmergency Planning & Resilience Officer Emergency Planning & Resilience Service

 Chapter 9 LondonRevision to Emergency PreparednessCivil Contingencies Act Enhancement ProgrammeMarch 2012
Chapter 9 (London) of Emergency Preparedness, Revised Version

 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE 9.1. In most respects, the frameworks and duties set out under the Act and the Regulations will apply to London in the same way that they apply everywhere else. In terms of the respective functions, Category 1 and 2 responders in London are no different from those in other parts of the country. However, London has particular patterns of public service provision and government which mean that some aspects of civil protection have to be organised differently. As London is the capital city, the effects of any incident can be felt right across the UK and potentially internationally.Local Resilience Forum in London9.2. London has the same need as elsewhere for multi-agency co-operation at the local level. To achieve multi-agency co-operation at this level, the Regulations establish one pan-London LRF covering all of London1 , incorporating the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police areas.9.3. The LRF will operate in much the same way as LRFs elsewhere, working to the model set out in Chapter 2.Borough Resilience Forums (BRF)9.4. As elsewhere, the LRF will maintain a Chief Officer Group, however, there are very distinct areas in London, each with specific emergency planning considerations which will require planning at a more local level than that of pan-London. For this reason, the revised Regulations specify that the London LRF must include, in respect of each borough, a BRF that meets at least once every six months.1 This is the area comprised of “the areas of the London boroughs, the City and the Temples” and defined as Greater London in s2(1) London Government Act 1963
The BRFs will primarily facilitate co-operation and information sharing at the operational level between local authorities and the emergency services, and should not duplicate the work of the LRF. They may refer issues to the LRF multi-borough tier, as appropriate.The role of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority
9.5. 9.6. 2 regulation 55
Unlike other areas, the Regulations provide that London’s local authorities will be supported in discharging their duties under the Act by the Fire and Rescue Authority - in this case, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA).2 LFEPA will take on a number of distinct tasks which might otherwise have been taken on by local authorities.LFEPA will carry out certain emergency planning activities. In particular, LFEPA will support pan-London local authority arrangements:o Local authority ‘Gold’: In the event of the most serious emergencies in London, local authorities would need to work closely together and operate in a consistent way. To deliver this, they have agreed to pooldecision-making authority and place it with a single chief executive who will speak for local authorities as the pan-London response is managed. LFEPA will maintain these arrangements, keeping them updated through review and revision.o Control centre: In order to support local authority ‘Gold’, planning will have to be maintained to deliver an effective control centre.Should local authority ‘Gold’ arrangements be required, the centre would collect and disseminate information, and facilitate the collective decision-making process. LFEPA will put in place and maintainthese arrangements.
o Provision of training to support pan-London arrangements:Certain elements of plans maintained under the Act will be consistent across all London boroughs, and this in turn leads to a consistency of training need. This need will be met by training programmes provided on request by LFEPA.o Provision of exercising of pan-London arrangements: Pan-London local authority plans need to be validated through exercising. LFEPA will design and deliver an annual programme of exercises to test these arrangements. This programme will include both local authority-only exercises, and multi-agency exercises in which local authority activities are engaged.9.7. LFEPA is funded separately for this work, with funding top-sliced from London local authorities.9.8. London boroughs will retain responsibility for discharging all other duties under the Act. However, LFEPA will continue to make an informal input into wider planning work within the framework of multi-agency co-operation. Should boroughs so wish, they may negotiate to delegate further functions to LFEPA.9.9. In discharging its responsibilities as set out above, LFEPA will also need to work closely with those Category 1 responders that are not local authorities. This has long been a matter of standard practice in London, but the Regulations reinforce this point by requiring co-operation between Category 1 responders and LFEPA at the latter’s request.3 This obligation is limited to that co-operation necessary for LFEPA to carry out its own obligations in relation to co-ordination of pan-London local authority planning.3 regulation 56
Sub-groups of the Local Resilience Forum9.10. Apart from the Chief Officer Group and the maintenance of BRFs, the London LRF’s make up will be determined by the Category 1 responders represented at the LRF, as set out in chapter 2. The LRF will determine which sub-groups are required for their particular area.9.11. While the Regulations set out that the London LRF must include, in relation to each borough, a BRF held once every six months, they do not specify which responders must attend them as they do for the LRF. Category 1 responders at the London LRF must therefore review and recommend which Category 1 responders should form the core membership for each BRF. As a group of the LRF all responders must consider whether to attend the BRF for any borough in which they exercise functions. In making this decision, those responders that have been identified by the London LRF as appropriate to form the core membership of a particular BRF must take this recommendation into account.9.12. Given its unique makeup and London’s role as the capital city, the London LRF will need to maintain a tier of multi-borough sub-groups of the LRF. These will consist of groups of boroughs, drawn up to reflect existing mutual aid groupings. This will assist emergency planning at the local level, bringing together those boroughs with particular issues and bridging the gap between the local level and the pan-London level. Previously these “sub-regional” LRFs have been set out in Regulation and therefore some groupings are already in place. The Category 1 members of the LRF will review and agree the groupings.9.1. 
9.13. The new Regulations create a pan-London LRF, which includes Borough Resilience Forums, and this statutory guidance sets out the need for multi-borough LRFs as sub-groups of the London LRF. This creates a three tier structure to emergency planning in London, with each tier having a very specific role to play in London resilience.Local Resilience Forum9.14. The role of the LRF is to provide strategic, senior level direction for co-ordinated and effective multi-agency emergency planning in London; bringing together national government (via the London Government Liaison Team in DCLG), the Mayor of London, London’s emergency services, other key public services and the business, faith and voluntary communities.9.15. The LRF will ensure that London is fully prepared to deal with the consequences of a wide range of disruptive incidents, from terrorist attacks through to the impact of climate change or a pandemic.9.16. The LRF will:o agree joint strategic and policy approaches relating to London’s preparedness and response;o produce and maintain a Risk Register for London, ensuring that it provides a robust basis for planning and reflects the current risks that are affecting the capital. This was formerly a duty carried out by LFEPA on behalf of the six multi-borough groupings but has now moved from this level to the pan-London level through the LRF. The regulations allowed for a transitional period of up to a year to facilitate this move;o 
o provide a mechanism for information on threat, hazard and risk management, flowing in both directions between local,sub-national and national organisations;o ensure that appropriate pan-London multi-agency plans, procedures, training and exercises necessary to address the identified or foreseeable local and wider area hazards are in place and outstandinggaps identified;o improve co-ordination across the capital by supporting cross-boundary working, mutual aid agreements and information sharing;o improve co-ordination with other areas;o review and recommend the core membership of each BRF;o review and agree the groupings of boroughs that comprise the multi-borough tier of emergency planning.Borough Resilience Forum9.17. Borough Resilience Forums will be responsible for multi-agency emergency planning at the local level as determined by borough risks and needs. They will also contribute to emergency planning for London, as directed by the London LRF. They will facilitate co-operation and information sharing between resilience partners at the local authority level and the London LRF.9.18. The LRF will:o agree on joint strategic and policy approaches relating to the area’s emergency preparedness and response;o approve the Risk Register for their area, ensuring it provides a robust basis for planning and records both borough level and relevant London wide risks;o 
o co-ordinate the individual approaches and responsibilities ofeach organisation to ensure that they complement each other and dovetail with partners’ arrangements; ando have regard to the implications of legislation and national initiatives and undertake its activities in accordance with strategic decisions agreed by the London LRF for the Borough Resilience Forum.Multi-borough sub-groups9.19. The multi-borough sub-groups of the LRF will support effective emergency planning by facilitating communication between member boroughs as well as communication between BRFs and the London LRF. The Category 1 responders of the LRF will review and agree from time to time whether the current groupings remain appropriate. These sub-groups will have a key role in driving up performance in emergency planning, ensuring comprehensive and consistent approaches are taken by BRFs in response to risks identified at the London LRF, as well as priority risks identified by member boroughs.9.20. Multi-borough sub-groups will:o establish mechanisms for ensuring a consistent approach to emergency planning at borough level around key and relevant risks identified by the London LRF and BRFs; ando establish mechanisms for ensuring that the London Resilience Forum emergency plan is delivered at the borough level;o 
Duty to assess risk9.21. BRF members, as Category 1 responders, have a duty to assess risk (see also Chapter 4). However, given that many of the risks in London are common to most boroughs, it is recommended that BRFs produce a Borough Risk Register. The requirement for a Community Risk Register will lie with the pan-London LRF and this should be used by BRFs to inform their risk assessment and emergency planning. Equally, the findings of BRF risk assessments will feed into the pan-London risk assessment.The Mayor of London / Greater London Authority (GLA)As the elected leader of London’s regional government, the Mayor of London9.22. plays a full part in supporting the effective implementation of the Act and improving the preparedness of the capital.In particular, the Mayor/GLA9.23. o is closely engaged in high-level discussions and decisions relating to the management of emergencies in London;o (or an appointed deputy) is currently Chair of the LRF;o contributes as necessary to the pre-informing of Londoners about the content of emergency plans, the correct behaviour in an emergency and good practice in terms of preparedness in the home, as part of initiatives organised both locally and at the UK level;o prepares to play a key role in warning and informing the public during an emergency in London; ando takes responsibility for civil protection issues in connection with the management of Parliament and Trafalgar Squares.o 
9.24. The GLA is a Category 1 responder under the Act and as such has the same responsibilities as other Category 1 responders. However, there are a number of duties that the GLA currently takes on in relation to London that are additional to other Category 1 responders.9.25. In particular, the GLA:o is responsible for the secretariat of the LRF;o is responsible for producing and maintaining a pan-London risk assessment; and publishing all or part of it in line with regulations; ando is responsible for the planning and exercising of pan-London emergency plans.o 
 Chapter 10 ScotlandRevision to Emergency PreparednessCivil Contingencies Act Enhancement ProgrammeOctober 2011
Chapter 10 (Scotland) of Emergency Preparedness,Revised Version WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE 10.1. The Act applies to a range of bodies in Scotland. However, responsibility for making Regulations and guidance on how responders in Scotland perform their duties under the Act is split between the Scottish Ministers and Ministers of the Crown. While the majority of responders exercise functions which fall within devolved competence (and so are subject to Regulations and guidance made by the Scottish Ministers), there are three responders which exercise functions that are largely reserved on a UK-wide basis. These bodies are subject to this guidance and to the Regulations made by a Minister of the Crown. These bodies are:o the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (included as a Category 1 responder);o the British Transport Police (included as a Category 1 responder); ando the Health and Safety Executive (included as a Category 2 responder).o 
Additionally,	three	industries	among	the	Category	2	responders	are reserved matters:o gas distributors;o electricity distributors; ando telecommunications companies.It is for Ministers of the Crown to issue guidance and Regulations to the companies concerned.10.2. The Regulations and this guidance apply to these Category 1 and 2 responders in much the same way as they apply to Category 1 and 2 responders elsewhere in the UK. The Regulations require these Category 1 and 2 responders to co-operate with other Category 1 and 2 responders in Scotland in the performance of their duties under the Act in much the same way as they are required to co-operate with other Category 1 and 2 responders in England and Wales. In particular, the Regulations require these Category 1 and 2 responders in Scotland to participate in Strategic Co-ordinating Groups (the equivalent of English and Welsh Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) and related activities, including compilation of a Community Risk Register.10.3. Chapters 2 to 8 explain in more detail how each duty under the Act is to be performed by Category 1 and 2 responders in Scotland that fall outside devolved competence.10.4. Regulations and guidance made by the Scottish Ministers detail how Scottish Category 1 and 2 responders, exercising functions within the devolved competence in Scotland, should perform their duties under the Act.10.1. 
10.5. In an emergency affecting Scotland, the lead Government department will be a UK Government department or the Scottish Government depending upon whether it primarily relates to a reserved or devolved matter. Where the emergency involves reserved functions the Scottish Government is very likely to be involved as well since there will almost certainly be consequences in devolved matters.10.6. The Scottish Government or Scotland Office, depending on the subject matter, are represented on the key committees and forums within central government relating to civil protection at both official and Ministerial levels. They work closely with relevant UK departments to ensure Scottish needs are catered for in UK planning and in policy development.10.7. The Scottish Government and UK departments act to ensure that they are aware of, and can play a complementary part in, the response to emergencies that affect Scotland.10.8. Preparing Scotland brings together, in one place, statutory guidance on the implementation of the Regulations, non-statutory guidance on good practice, and the integration of national and local planning for emergencies in respect of devolved functions. It is published at www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/06/12094636/1 10.1.

 Chapter 11 WalesRevision to Emergency PreparednessCivil Contingencies Act Enhancement ProgrammeOctober 2011
Chapter 11 (Wales) of Emergency Preparedness, Revised VersionSummaryï The arrangements set out in Part 1 of the Act apply in Wales. However, there are some differences in the requirements which the Regulations place on Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales because of the unique administrative arrangements in Wales (paragraphs 11.1–11.5).ï While functions under Part 1 of the Act have not been transferred to the Welsh Ministers, the Welsh Government has significant interest in this area and is primarily responsible for a number of Category 1 and 2 responders (paragraphs 11.6–11.14).ï Category 1 and 2 responders and other organisations are engaged in response work together with the Welsh Government to address large-scale civil protection issues in Wales. The Wales Resilience Forum (WRF) promotes good communication and the enhancement of emergency planning across agencies and services in Wales by pro- viding a forum for Chief Officers to discuss with Welsh Ministers strategic issues of emergency preparedness. The WRF is not a statutory body nor does it have powers to direct its members, Local Resilience Forums or individual Category 1 or 2 responders as defined under the Act. The WRF provides collective strategic direction to the Wales Capabilities Programme and individual member leadership to the various capabilities sub-groups co-ordinated through a Wales Resilience Partnership Team (paragraphs 11.20–11.32).ï 
 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE 11.1. The duties in Part 1 of the Act apply in the same way in Wales as they do in England.Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales are subject to the Regulations and guidance made by a Minister of the Crown after liaison with the Welsh Ministers. The Welsh Government has a statutory role to play in the introduction of regulations and guidance which relate wholly or partly to Wales. When a Minister of the Crown issues a risk assessment to a Category 1 responder exercising functions in Wales, the Regulations require the Minister of the Crown to consult Welsh Ministers.11.2. In addition, there are some differences in the requirements which the Regulations place on Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales because of the unique administrative arrangements in Wales.Co-operation11.3. As in England, the principal mechanism for co-operation between Category 1 and 2 responders under the Act is the Local Resilience Forums (LRFs). Each LRF considers its own membership and subgroup structures.Risk assessment11.4. In Wales, the detailed risk assessment process is undertaken at the LRF level where Community Risk Registers (CRR) are produced and maintained in the same way as in England. To support this work the Wales Risk Assessment Group (WRAG) brings together the Chairs of the LRF Risk Assessment Groups to facilitate the sharing of best practice and consistency of approach across the four Groups. The WRAG produces a Wales Risk Register on an annual basis which provides a summary of11.1. 
the risks in Wales and which is based on information from the Community Risk Registers and the National Risk Register. 111.5. The Regulations under the Act allow the UK Government to issue risk assessments to Category 1 responders. This information is disseminated, via the Welsh Government to Category 1 responders in Wales. The Welsh Government is then able to issue risk assessments in Wales where it is appropriate for it to do so, subject to the consent of the UK Government.2The role of the Welsh Government11.6. The UK Government and the Welsh Government work together on the development of civil protection policy. Both parties consult with each other and exchange information on civil protection planning and response in a timely and constructive manner. The UK Government consults the Welsh Government as early as possible on any policy proposals (eg. strategic guidance and national frameworks) relating to emergencies which affect, or may affect, Wales.3Devolved responsibility under the Act11.7. Responsibility for local civil protection arrangements under Part 1 of the Act in England and Wales remains, in general, the responsibility of the UK Government. However, functional responsibilities in relation to health, the environment, animal health and welfare, local government, economic development, the fire and rescue authorities, road networks and rail services enable the Welsh Government to engage in aspects of civil protection work and, as a consequence, play an important co-ordinating role. This points to the importance of ensuring good communications between the UK Government and the Welsh Government.1 regulation 14(5)2 regulation 14(3)3 s.16(1-4)
11.8. Part 1 of the Act confers a number of delegated powers on Ministers of the Crown.In particular, the content of the Regulations, orders, directions and guidance made by them under Part 1 of the Act have a significant impact on the preparation for, and handling of, emergencies. The Welsh Government will be involved as soon as possible in the development of Regulations, orders, directions and guidance under Part 1 of the Act where this action directly affects Welsh Category 1 and 2 responders, or where there are significant cross border implications.411.9. Where action is taken by the UK Government under Part 1 of the Act i.e (making regulations or orders, giving directions, issuing guidance or taking enforcement action), which applies to bodies in relation to which the Welsh Government has functions, the UK Government must seek the consent of the Welsh Ministers. In other cases where such action applies to Wales, the UK Government must consult the Welsh Ministers.511.10. Should further functions be devolved to Welsh Ministers, agreement to ‘consult’ will be adjusted to a ‘consent’ agreement where appropriate. The consent of Welsh Ministers is required for the addition, removal and movement of local responders in Wales listed under the Act for which the Welsh Government has responsibility. In cases where local responders in Wales are not within devolved competence, Welsh Ministers will be consulted.11.11. When requesting information from Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales under Section 9(1) of the Act, the UK Government will consider the case for using the Welsh Government to co-ordinate the process of gathering information on a pan-Wales basis. In other cases the UK Government will consider on a case-by-case basis the need to inform the Welsh Government of any request by it for information from:4 s.16(1-4)5 s.16(1-4)
o individual Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales which fall within devolved responsibility (eg. the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust); ando Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales which fall outside devolved responsibility (eg. the police).11.12. Where appropriate, the Welsh Government will work with Category 1 and2 responders in developing pan-Wales plans. In developing plans, the Welsh Government will be able to offer advice to Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales in terms of consistency with pan-Wales and pan-UK plans.Communication with the UK Government11.13. The Welsh Government or Wales Office, depending on the subject matter, is represented on the key committees and forums within UK government relating to civil protection at both official and ministerial levels. They work closely with UK government departments to ensure that UK civil protection policy and planning is tailored to Welsh needs. The UK Government works with the Welsh Government to ensure that it is kept informed and copied in to all information which will assist it in carrying out its responsibilities under the Act.Concordat between the Welsh Government and the UK Government11.14. A Concordat between the Welsh Government and the UK Government provides clarification as to how both sides see the role of the Welsh Government being delivered in practice under the Act. This guidance addresses this issue exhaustively in relation to Part 1 of the Act (“local arrangements for civil protection”) and therefore the Concordat focuses exclusively on Part 2 (“emergency powers”) issues. The Concordat is published on UK Resilience website: www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ukresilience11.1. 
Co-operation11.15. Generally, the models of operation and representation as set out in Chapter 2 will apply in Wales. But there are differences because Wales has a devolved administration and because of different NHS structures.11.16. The Welsh Government is represented on all four LRFs in Wales in an observer capacity. Local responders should also seek to engage the Welsh Government on wider issues, including notifying the Welsh Government of the appointment of a lead responder in any of the four LRFs.11.17. Welsh NHS organisations are engaged in civil protection at every level. Health Boards and Trusts progress this work individually and collectively through local health emergency planning co-ordinating groups and through the all-Wales Health Emergency Planning Advisory Group. The NHS is also appropriately represented on multi-agency groups including the strategic LRFs. The Health Protection Agency is linked into health emergency planning arrangements in Wales and provides specialist advice during both the planning and response stages. The Welsh Government’s Health and Social Care Department provides health emergency planning policy guidance to the NHS and works with the Department of Health in reviewing and developing health resilience.11.1. 
Information sharing11.18. Where appropriate, the WRF will play a part, in co-ordinating the request for information between Category 1 and 2 responders in Wales. In this way, the WRF can be used as a vehicle for consideration of information sharing issues which affect a range of responders across Wales.Business continuity management11.19. As in England, Category 1 responders in Wales will maintain plans to ensure that they can continue to exercise their functions in the event of an emergency, so far as is reasonably practicable.Welsh civil contingencies frameworkPan-Wales planning11.20. Two discrete types of planning are undertaken at the pan-Wales level. The first type of planning supports emergency preparedness through capability development; the second supports response arrangements at the Wales level.Wales Resilience Forum (WRF)11.21. The principal mechanism for multi-agency co-operation at the Wales level is the WRF.11.22. The WRF has senior representation from the Welsh Government, Cabinet Office, local authorities, the emergency services, the armed forces, the Environment Agency Wales, NHS Wales, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. The forum considers planning and preparation matters and it functions in11.1. 
a similar way to multi - LRF groupings in England but with a higher level of political involvement as a consequence of devolved responsibilities.11.23. The WRF works alongside other elements of the multi-agency civil protection framework at the local and UK government levels. However, this framework is not a hierarchy. LRFs in Wales are not subordinate to the WRF. Communication and co-ordination flow in both directions. The LRFs operate in a similar way to their counterparts in England.Wales Resilience Forum business plan11.24. The strategic framework for capability development in Wales is set out in the Wales Resilience Forum Business Plan which is produced on an annual basis. The primary objective of the Business Plan is to clearly identify the relationship between planning for emergencies at the local, Wales and UK levels and to co-ordinate this work. The Business Plan ensures that co-ordination work at the pan-Wales level adds value to work being undertaken at other levels. At the core of the plan is a Wales Resilience Partnership Team, established to co-ordinate civil protection work in Wales.Local Resilience Forums11.25. As in England, the Act necessitated a restructuring of joint-agency planning in Wales resulting in the creation of LRFs in South Wales, Gwent, North Wales and Dyfed-Powys Police Force areas. The LRFs are supported by co-ordinating groups, sub-groups or task and finish groups established to develop various capabilities or set specific targets in strengthening local resilience through multi-agency collaboration.11.1. 
Joint Emergency Services Group11.26. The Joint Emergency Services Group brings together all the emergency services and armed forces in Wales to consider how to meet their duties collectively under the Act, and how to take forward their contribution to civil protection in Wales. The group has jointly funded the post of an Emergency Services Civil Contingencies Co-ordinator for Wales, to co-ordinate the work of the emergency services in all aspects of civil protection.Welsh Borders Resilience Group11.27. To facilitate co-operation and information sharing between Wales and the border areas of England, a group has been formed which brings together the Welsh Government with the Department for Communities and Local Government, Resilience Emergency Division (DCLG (RED)). The group meets on a regular basis to discuss issues of mutual interest in civil contingencies and to help foster links at both the regional and local levels.Welsh Government Civil Contingencies Group11.28. In recognition of its functional responsibilities and its territorial role, the Welsh Government has adopted a collegiate approach to civil protection in Wales. The Welsh Government has established a Civil Contingencies Group (CCG), led by a Director-General, dedicated to supporting multi-agency co-operation in Wales and engaging with the UK Government on all issues relating to civil protection and emergency preparedness. This CCG is supplemented by a wide variety of subject matter experts, based on the Welsh Government’s functional responsibilities, who support planning and response arrangements in Wales. For example, such support is provided by the Health Emergency Planning Unit and specialists in environmental11.1. 
health, health, environmental science, animal health, and flood and coastal erosion risk management. This approach ensures that the Welsh Government is well placed to support Category 1 responders on civil protection matters and on specific resilience issues.Welsh Government Emergencies Branch11.29. The Welsh Government’s Emergencies Branch works in partnership with Category 1 and 2 responders and other organisations engaged in civil protection in Wales. The Branch fosters and maintains links with emergency planners in local authorities, emergency services and utilities companies, in order to co-ordinate civil protection planning in Wales. It also maintains links with UK Government Departments and other devolved administrations to share best practice and undertake joint-working.11.30. To maintain the Welsh Government’s co-ordination role the Branch provides the secretariat support to the Wales Resilience Forum, the Wales Resilience Partnership Team and various pan-Wales sub-groups.11.1.

Chapter 12 (Northern Ireland) of Emergency Preparedness, Revised Version
 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE 12.1. The duties in the Act apply only to a limited number of organisations which deliver functions that are not transferred or which were not transferred at the time the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 was made. These organisations are:o the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) (included as a Category 1 responder);o the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) (included as a Category 1 responder); ando telecommunications operators (included as Category 2 responders).o 
12.2. As these organisations do not represent the full spectrum of response agencies in Northern Ireland, the Regulations treat these organisations in a slightly different way. The following principles apply to those Category 1 and 2 responders which operate in Northern Ireland:o The Regulations which relate to how individual Category 1 and2 responders should perform their duties apply to Category 1 and 2 responders in Northern Ireland in the usual way, but with some adjustments for the Northern Ireland situation.o The provisions which rely on bilateral co-operation between Category 1 and 2 responders apply to Northern Ireland.o The provisions in the Regulations relating to the Local Resilience Forum and its activities, including the production of a Community Risk Register, do not apply to Northern Ireland.o Category 1 responders in Northern Ireland should have regardto the activities of other bodies in Northern Ireland that are engaged in civil protection (including Northern Ireland departments, the Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Serviceand relevant utilities) and, where appropriate, may rely on or adopt those activities.2o Category 1 responders in Northern Ireland may delegate their functions to, or exercise their functions jointly with, other bodies in Northern Ireland who are engaged in civil protection.1 regulation 62 regulation 57, 58
o	The Northern Ireland Department of Justice has the full rangeof Ministerial responsibilities in relation to the police’s delivery of its duties under the CCA in relation to events or situations which threaten serious damage to human welfare and/or which threaten3serious damage to the environment.  This Guidance therefore appliesto the PSNI only in relation to emergencies arising from war or terrorism threatening serious damage to the United Kingdom. The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland may issue separate guidance for the PSNI in respect of other emergencies to which the Act applies.12.3. In practice, the PSNI, MCA and telecommunications operators in Northern Ireland undertake their individual and co-operative duties under the Act, but relate to the other public service bodies listed in the Regulations 4 in line with the arrangements in the Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework, and by participating in Northern Ireland co-operation, co-ordination and crisis management machinery.12.4. The Northern Ireland organisations have a reciprocal requirement under the Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework to co-operate with the PSNI, MCA and telecommunications operators in the discharge of their duties under the Act.12.5. Chapters 2 to 8 explain in more detail how each duty under the Act is to be performed by Category 1 and 2 responders in Northern Ireland.3 See sections 1(4A), 2(6) to (9) and 3(6) CCA as amended by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Devolution of Policing and Justice Functions) Order 2010, Schedule 3, paragraphs 94 to 977.4 regulation 57
Civil contingencies in Northern Ireland12.6. Civil contingencies are largely a devolved matter with responsibilities lying with Northern Ireland government departments. Overall policy and strategy co-ordination falls to the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM). The Northern Ireland Executive has oversight of civil contingencies arrangements for transferred functions.12.7. The Northern Ireland Office has responsibility for national security matters. It maintains crisis management arrangements to govern the strategic response to such emergencies.12.8. The lead government department principle applies in Northern Ireland where the lead Northern Ireland department is the department with day-to-day policy responsibility for the subject in question.12.9. In Northern Ireland many functions which are delivered elsewhere in the UK by local authorities are delivered directly by Northern Ireland departments, or by their agencies or non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). This means that some activities which in Great Britain are covered by duties under the Act are in Northern Ireland carried out under lead department arrangements.12.10. Lead departments in Northern Ireland are broadly similar to those at the UK level in terms of roles and responsibilities. Details of lead departments can be found www. cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ukresilience. Information on Northern Ireland arrangements can be found in A Guide to Emergency Planning Arrangements in Northern Ireland www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/aguidetoemergencyplanningarrangements.pdf12.1. 
12.11. The Northern Ireland devolved administration or Northern Ireland Office (NIO), depending on the subject matter, is represented on the key committees and forums within UK central government relating to civil protection at both official and Ministerial levels. They work closely with UK departments to ensure Northern Ireland needs are catered for in UK planning and policy development.12.12. In an emergency affecting Northern Ireland, the devolved administration will be involved because of its territorial role and its responsibilities for impact management, although lead responsibility will depend on the nature of the emergency and the devolution settlement.The Civil Contingencies Policy Branch12.13. The Civil Contingencies Policy Branch (CCPB) is located within the OFMDFM. Its role is to:o co-ordinate information and advice to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the Executive on civil contingencies planningand policy;o promote civil contingencies preparedness across NI departments through provision of information and guidance and maintenance of effective civil contingencies policies;o facilitate co-ordination of contingencies preparedness across NI departments and the wider public sector when issues are cross-cutting;o maintain the NI Central Crisis Management Arrangements (see Chapter 12 in Emergency Response and Recovery).12.14. The CCPB provides information and expertise to planners within organisations and facilitates co-ordination of planning between organisations through formal and informal structures and dialogue. Its customers are primarily government12.1. 
departments and agencies but the emergency services and other public service bodies are also engaged. The CCPB also represents Northern Ireland interests in policy discussions at UK and international levels.Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework12.15. The Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework sets out the principles of policy and practice which will be adhered to by Northern Ireland public service organisations in their civil contingencies activities. The principles in the Framework are derived from existing Northern Ireland arrangements and structures and from the underlying principles of the Act and other UK policies. The Framework is supported by guidance documents, including A Guide to Emergency Planning Arrangements in Northern Ireland www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/aguidetoemergencyplanningarrangements.pdf  and A Guide to Risk Assessment in Northern Ireland www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/guide_to_ risk_assessment_in_northern_ireland_-_january_2010-2.pdf12.16. The Framework requires Northern Ireland public service organisations to co-operate with those organisations in Northern Ireland which have duties under Part 1 of the Act.The Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland12.17. The Civil Contingencies Group, Northern Ireland (CCG(NI)) is a pan-Northern Ireland multi-agency forum for the development, discussion and agreement of civil protection policy for the Northern Ireland public services. In addition to its policy role, the CCG(NI) supports strategic co-ordination of emergencies as part of the Northern Ireland Central Crisis Management Arrangements in a serious or catastrophic emergency.12.1. 
12.18. The CCG(NI) meets on a regular basis (at least two to three times per year) to review strategic issues. The CCG(NI) may also establish subgroups or working groups to deal with development of policy and good practice guidance on particular topics or areas of concern.12.19. The specific functions of the CCG(NI) are to:o undertake periodic review of civil protection policy in government departments and public bodies in Northern Irelandas appropriate, and will seek and gain agreement on policy principles and standards;o maintain liaison among government departments, theemergency services, other key public service bodies and District Councils;o disseminate information to and within member organisations on civil protection policy, current issues and risks and the response to emergencies; and will provide briefing on particular issuesor emergencies;o collect and collate the information necessary to inform policy development or the response to emergencies and provide briefing on particular issues or emergencies;o establish standing or ad hoc sub-groups or working groups to develop policy for, or report on, particular issues or functions; ando discuss and co-ordinate the non-emergency service responses to emergencies which require a multi-agency strategic approach but which do not require the attention of Permanent Secretaries or Ministers.o 
12.20. The group is chaired by a senior official from the OFMDFM. Its membership includes senior representatives from the bodies listed in Box 12.1.Box 12.1: membership of the CCG(NI)CCG(NI)ï Civil Contingencies Policy Branch(CCPB)ï Northern Ireland Fire and RescueServiceï 12 Northern Ireland departmentsï Local Government EmergencyManagement Group (LGEMG)ï Northern Ireland Office (NIO)ï Maritime and CoastguardAgency (MCA)ï Executive Information Serviceï Police Service of NorthernIreland (PSNI)ï Food Standards AgencyNorthern Irelandï Northern Ireland Ambulance Service12.21. As well as representing their immediate organisations, members also represent the interests of associated regional, sub-regional and local public service organisations.12.22. Various other co-ordination arrangements exist for planning and responding to specific situations. These are set up as needed by the key organisations involved. There are, for example, groups for flooding, overseas nuclear accidents and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear issues.Local arrangements12.23. Co-ordination at the local level may be facilitated by a range of organisations, depending on the nature and outcome of particular emergencies. The PSNI and the district councils have key roles to play in co-ordination at local level.12.1. 
Cross-border arrangements12.24. At local level, the emergency services have arrangements for co-ordinating the response to incidents at, or near, the border. Other arrangements are in place for co-ordinating information and efforts in areas such as public health emergencies and the response to nuclear accidents. These arrangements supplement national- level arrangements for co-ordination and co-operation through agencies such as the European Union.Further information12.25. Further information can be found in the CCPB document A Guide to Emergency Planning Arrangements in Northern Ireland. This, and other documents on civil contingencies arrangements mentioned in this chapter, are available from the CCPB website.www. ofmdfmni.gov.uk/index/making-government-work/civilcontingencies.htm12.1.

Chapter 13 (Support and challenge) of Emergency Preparedness, Revised Version
 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE Monitoring by the Government and by local responders13.1. The Act gives a Minister 1 powers to require:o the provision of information about actions taken by a Category 1 or 2 responder in the performance of its Part 1 duties 2; ando an explanation as to why the responder has not taken action to comply with its duties under Part 1 of the Act.3Box 13.1: How monitoring powers might be usedThe Government would be most likely to use its monitoring powers to probe perceived systemic failures in the operation of the Act. For example, if a particular class of Category 2 responder is not sharing information about its local sectoral arrangements, Category 1 responders would be likely to bring this to the attention of their representative bodies. Those representative bodies would then pass this concern on to the Government.The Government might then use these powers to request from all Category 1 and 2 responders in that particular sector details of the nature and volume of the information requests they had received under the Act, and how they had responded. The material provided would allow the Government to judge whether the sector was avoiding its obligations, or whether it was being put under unreasonable pressure, or whether there was some form of blockage in the system that could be removed. The Government could then take action, from adjusting the guidance so as to change expectations through to taking action in the courts
1 ‘Minister of the Crown’ or ‘Minister’ refers to the most appropriate Minister in the given situation.2 S 9(1)(a)3 S 9(1)(b)
PAGE 3
13.2. The Government relies on current good practice in performance management and on established audit and regulatory bodies across the Category 1 and 2 organisations to assess performance.13.3. However, where the Government has reason in a particular case to require more information about responder compliance with the duties, and to seek an explanation for non-compliance, these monitoring powers may be used.13.4. The powers will usually be exercised by the Minister with lead responsibility for civil contingencies. However, all proposals to exercise these powers would be developed in close collaboration with relevant lead government departments, and the Devolved Administrations, and agreed between departments and administrations with an interest.The role of Ministers in Scotland and Northern Ireland13.5. The Act 4 gives Scottish Ministers powers to require:o the provision of information about actions taken by Scottish Category 1 or 2 responders 5 in the performance of its Part 1 duties; ando an explanation as to why the responder has not taken action to comply with its duties under Part 1 of the Act.13.6. The Act 6 gives the Northern Ireland Department of Justice powers to require:o the provision of information about actions taken by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) 7 in the performance of its Part 1 duties in relation to its devolved functions ; and4 S 115 Sch1 p 2 & 46 S 9 as amended by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Devolution of Policing and Justice Functions) Order 2010.7 The Act assigns responder status to the Chief Constable.
o an explanation as to why the responder has not taken action to comply with its duties under Part 1 of the Act in relation to its devolved functions.13.7. Powers in relation to non-devolved functions of the PSNI would be exercised by a Minister of the Crown.Local arrangements for assurance and accountability13.8. Regulations require that specific and generic emergency plans drawn up by Category 1 organisations include provisions to test and exercise those plans.813.9. The government relies on:o all Category 1 responders, as members of the Local Resilience Forum (LRF), taking ownership and responsibility for their performance and supporting their members and partners. By ensuring that:ï responders fulfil their roles within this framework and, where appropriate, issues are escalated or de-escalated; andï members are committed to ensuring the partnership is strong and they can promote high consistent standards and make effective, efficient use of resources.o current good practice in performance management within responders and forums;o locally driven reviews of plans and risk assessments to provide assurance as part of the Big Society agenda and Localism Bill 9 ; ando established audit and regulatory bodies across the Category 1 and 2 organisations to assess performance.8 Reg 259 Regulations also require Category 1 responders to publish community risk registers. It is likely that many responders will be subject to locally driven accountability through the localism agenda, which empowers communities to take decisions about their area and the delivery of public services
13.10. A forum could become aware of its collective, corporate strengths and weaknesses, or those of an organisation, through communication from organisations, whistle-blowers, regulators, government departments and agencies, the media, inquiries, de-briefs, or complaints from members of the public.13.11. Category 1 and 2 responders need to assure themselves that their arrangements and plans are robust. Those that have legal responsibilities (under the Civil Contingencies Act and other legislation) need to be constantly vigilant to ensure that they are meeting their responsibilities.13.12. Responders should ensure their systems, plans and processes in relation to emergency preparedness are fit for purpose. Periodic reviews of these, using the suggested methods and guidance in paragraphs 13.13 - 13.14 will help them identify their strengths and weaknesses and provide external assurance, where required, to such bodies as:o Partners in the wider resilience community ;o Peer groups;o Local resilience forums;o Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) Resilience and Emergencies Division (DCLG RED);o Scottish Government;o Welsh Government ;o Northern Ireland Executive;o Regulators and inspectorates;o Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat; ando The local community.PAGE 6
13.13. Responders work together identifying strengths and weaknesses to support and challenge each other within local resilience forums or the wider resilience community to:o develop knowledge, skills, attributes and capacity;o identify capability gaps or emerging issues; ando resolve issues by sharing lessons, focusing on improvements and improving transparency to demonstrate improvements in relation to local assessments. ASSESSMENT TOOLS	13.14. Public and private sector organisations have a clear understanding of their business, what they want to achieve, how to achieve it and whether they are achieving it. The organisation, its managers and its staff must understand what is expected of them and what they can expect of others in all areas of their work. Systems and processes which help achieve this, and external validation and assurance, include:o business plans;o risk assessment assurance processes;o internal audit and quality assurance systems;o performance and line management activities;o periodic testing and exercising;o peer review;o plan validation;o joint exercising of plans (including debriefing);o 
o local authority scrutiny powers (LA scrutiny powers enable local councillors to represent the views of citizens on local services).o learning lessons from exercises and incidents;o Civil Protection Self Assessment Tools (CPSAT), a voluntary online tool designed to help responders monitor and assess how they deliver their responsibilities for civil contingencies in their areas;o Expectation Set and Indicators of Good Practice for Category 1and 2 responders aims to clarify what is expected of Category 1 and 2 responders in England and Wales in relation to:ï the duties within the Civil Contingencies Act 2004; 10ï the associated Contingency Planning Regulations 2005 (Regulations) and guidance; 11ï the National Resilience Capabilities Programme (which is the core framework through which the government is seeking to build resilience across all parts of the United Kingdom; andï Emergency Response and Recovery http://www.cabinetoffice. gov.uk/content/emergency-response-and-recovery, which aims to establish good practice based on lessons identified from responding to and recovering from emergencies, both in the UK and internationally. It accompanies Emergency Preparedness which provides guidance on how to implement the CCA regime; and

PAGE 8
o The Role of LRFs: A Reference Document highlights some of the key aspects that demonstrate robust compliance with the duties under the CCA and Regulations. The principal aim of this document is to encourage and support LRFs in learning and continuous development, taking forward their capabilities in civil contingencies, emergency preparedness and elements of response and recovery. It is for use individually and collectively by organisations that constitute an LRF orcontribute to its work. Assurance agencies may also use this document in guiding their assessments of engagement among local agencies in their collective LRF responsibilities and in supporting the agencies’ effortsto manage and develop their individual and collective effectiveness.13.15. Different arrangements apply in Northern Ireland and Scotland; details on the Northern Ireland Civil Contingencies Framework can be found on: http://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk/ ni_civil_contingencies_framework_-_refreshed_september_2011-2.pdf and for Scotland at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/06/12094636/3Sharing the load13.16. The Civil Contingencies Act also empowers responders to:o jointly discharge duties;o identify a lead responder; and/oro delegate delivery of their responsibilities to another organisation.o 
13.17. However, when discharging or delegating duties, the partners involved must determine the arrangements that are best suited to their local circumstances and service users needs. Those that opt for these approaches still retain overall responsibility for their duties under the Act. They can delegate but not abdicate (Chapter 2 of Emergency Preparedness: Co-operation explains this in further detail). They must ensure they are effectively represented at LRFs. It is, therefore, vital that when jointly discharging or delegating functions, organisations:o actively engage in resilience worko actively support and challenge each othero ensure high performance standardsSupport from Local Resilience Forums13.18. Local Resilience Forums are not legal entities and the duties rest with responders.This does not mean that a forum and its members are powerless to intervene to develop its members’ performance. A forum’s strength rests in the co-operative and team working nature of the relationships between organisations and the trust that the members have built between them. Collectively, forums can give leadership and bring considerable peer pressure and support to bear.13.19. The forums can help their member organisations to:o develop knowledge, skills, attributes and capacity;o share best practice;o identify issues;o resolve issues;o support the compilation of the community risk register;o plan for emergencies;o 
o develop systematic, planned and co-ordinated approaches to delivering resilience functions;o work beyond the LRF boundary; ando support the preparation of multi-agency plans.13.20. They can support their members by encouraging and fostering team-working, co-operation, and bi-lateral arrangements between the member organisations. Forums can also help to broker bi-lateral arrangements.Peer challenge13.21. Peer review involves the evaluation of an organisation or individual’s work by others working in the same field. Peer challenge takes this a step further. Formally challenging an individual or organisation, can damage relationships, impede co-operation and/or result in those who are challenged becoming defensive or disengaged. Handling of the approach should be proportionate and diplomatic.13.22. It is important to identify whether the difficulty lies with the organisation or with the individual. For example, an organisation’s representative may not have the seniority, or the support from the organisation’s senior management, to commit resources or direct strategy. (Chapter 5, Emergency Preparedness, provides guidance on senior management engagement). Some responders may need help in engaging their senior managers.13.1. 

13.23. 13.2413.25.13.26.
When earlier attempts to support an organisation have been rebuffed, a Local Resilience Forum may need to challenge rather than support that organisation. However, representatives of the LRF must take care to ensure that their approach is not counter-productive; an approach based on influencing and persuading is likely to be more effective than one based on a command and control approach as the relationship is essentially one of co-operation. See paragraphs 13.24 and13.25 for information about escalating issues.Formally requesting action on behalf of the LRFSometimes a more formal approach is needed, particularly when urgent action is needed to resolve issues and when less formal support and challenge has failed. The members of the LRF can do this collectively through the chair or secretariat.If a formal approach, usually in written form outlining what action is required and by when, proves necessary, the LRF members will set a deadline for action to be taken and monitor the response to the request and the response’s impact. This will inform the next steps and the decision on whether it needs to de-escalate the issue, intervene further, or escalate the issue.Triggers for escalating and de-escalating issuesIt is important that issues are addressed at the most appropriate level. All members of the resilience community must take responsibility for ensuring that an issue is referred to the appropriate person, team or organisation in a timely proportionate manner.
Support from Department of Communities and Local Government Resilience and Emergencies Division (DCLG RED) in England13.27. The Resilience and Emergencies Division helps responders identify for themselves the risks they face, mitigate those risks, and manage the impact of risks that materialise, including through liaison with central government departments. See Chapter 16: Collaboration and Cooperation between Local Resilience Forums in England13.28. The Resilience and Emergencies Division will:o act as a critical friend, question rationales, suggest alternatives, share good practice and support local planning activities;o provide a support mechanism – helping local partners develop an appropriate response capability, brokering advance mutual aid agreements between areas;o make links between local responders and the lead government departments;o supporting cross boundary strategies, protocols and procedures whilst ensuring a close fit with both the needs of Government in a national emergency and the needs of the local responders; ando support local and national exercising - helping to ensure lessons learnt are effectively shared across the relevant partnership.o 
Support from Welsh Government Resilience Team in Wales13.29. The Welsh Government Resilience Team fulfils a similar role in Wales to that undertaken by DCLG RED in England. Additionally, the team:o supports local and cross-LRF activities and leads on all-Wales co-ordination;o acts as a link between LRFs through representation on the forums and their supporting co-ordinating groups;o facilitates all-Wales capabilities groups which bring together the relevant LRF sub-group Chairs;o works in conjunction with the joint emergencies services groups and LRFs to delivery pan-Wales training and exercising; ando acts as a link with Cabinet Office, other Whitehall departments and other devolved administrations.Role of the regulators and inspectorates13.30. In addition to the self monitoring processes outlined within this guidance, the Government relies upon regulatory and inspectorate bodies across the range of responder organisations to support self assessment in relation to responders meeting their responsibilities under the Act. Regulators have an important role to play and can help responders in a number of ways through:o undertaking governance or diagnostic interventions to highlight organisational strengths and weaknesses and follow up as necessary;o reducing the bureaucratic burden on responders by accepting evidence from self assessment and peer reviews as part of their inspection regimes;o 
o highlighting and validating good practice for organisations to build upon;o sharing knowledge and good practice within and between organisations;o contribute to Government work in producing self assessment tools and guidance.13.31. Outputs from regulatory reviews or inspections can provide responders with a rich source of information upon which to produce and implement plans to improve and fill identified capability gaps.13.32. Bodies which oversee performance of public service provision by Category 2 responders operating under license arrangements such as Ofcom for the telecommunications industry or Ofwat for the water industry, impose sector specific standards relating to the provision of services and are responsible for monitoring performance and taking remedial action when standards fall below expectations.Role of the national tier13.33. The Government has established a framework to support national emergency planning in a linked and structured way. This is now well established and embedded. Parliamentary scrutiny of the activities of the Government is ongoing and the National Audit Office audits departmental accounts and reports to Parliament. The Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat provides cross-cutting oversight and co-ordination of resilience activity at the national level. All the current duties of Category 1 and 2 responders are reflected and shadowed by activity co-ordinated by the Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) at the national level. Similar activity is undertaken in lead government departments. This activity and attendant responsibilities are driven and/or monitored via:13.27. 
o the National Resilience Capabilities Programme (NRCP) (see paragraph 13.34);o the Lead Government Departments Expected Capabilities, this amplifies guidance in CONOPs and The Lead Government Departmentand its role – Guidance and Best Practice – https://update.cabinetoffice.gov. uk/sites/default/files/resources/lead-government-departments-role.pdfo Central Government’s Concept of Operations (CONOPs);o National Capabilities Survey;o the Resilience sub-committee of the National Security Council.NSC oversees all aspects of the UK’s security. Government departments with key security related functions are all represented on the National Security Council. NSC (THRC) is a Ministerial sub-committee of NSC. Its remit is to consider threats, hazards, resilience and contingencies strategy; ando Ministerial departments are required to develop and publish business plans, which show how they will deliver their services and objectives. They are judged against their delivery of these and ministers are required to report publicly on them.13.34. The cross-Government National Resilience Capabilities Programme is co-ordinated by the Cabinet Office. It brings together work stream lead departments. Each of these departments has particular responsibility for one or more aspects of emergency response at the national level, for example the Department of Health has responsibility for the national tier of emergency response in the event of pandemic flu. To assess the level of preparedness and capability nationally, the programme uses the National Resilience Planning Assumptions (NRPAs) which set out the baseline capability necessary to respond to, and recover from, specific risks as set out in the annually updated National Risk Assessment (NRA).PAGE 16
 MINISTERIAL POWERS AND ACCOUNTABILITY	13.35. All Secretaries of State are accountable to Parliament for the performance of their department and may be called to account by the relevant Select Committees. There is a constitutional expectation that ministers will co-operate across government. Resilience activity is co-ordinated across Government by NSC (THRC)(R). This is shadowed by an officials committee NSC (THRC)(R)(O).13.36. The aim of NSC (THRC)(R) is to develop the resilience of the UK to withstand disruptive events (both malicious threats and non-malicious hazards), ensuring that (inter alia):o government at all levels identifies and assesses emerging short/medium term risks and vulnerabilities;o specific contingency capabilities are in place where specific risks are in sight; ando there is rigorous evaluation of UK resilience. ENFORCEMENT	Enforcement under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 via Category 1 and 2 responders13.37. A Category 1 or 2 responder may itself take court action, in respect of a failure by another responder body to comply with its main duties under the Act.12 Examples of the cause for such an action might be where one responder is unreasonably:o withholding information from another; oro failing to be represented at an LRF meeting.12 S 10(1)(b)–(c) and S 11(1)(b)-(c)
13.38. It is not anticipated that these powers will be used frequently. Where they are used, the Act also gives the High Court or the Court of Session powers to grant any relief or make any order as it thinks appropriate.13Enforcement by Ministers13.39. In a particular case, the Government may not be satisfied with the information received from a Category 1 or 2 responder, about the performance of its duties, or with the explanation given for non compliance. In these circumstances, the Minister may choose to take enforcement proceedings in the High Court or Court of Session.1413.40. As with the powers to monitor performance, court proceedings will usually be taken by the Minister with lead responsibility for civil contingencies. However, all proposals to do so would be developed in close collaboration with relevant lead government departments and the Devolved Administrations and agreed between departments and administrations with an interest.Enforcement under other legislation13.41. Other resilience legislation is monitored and enforced under the terms of that legislation. See Chapter 19 on The Fit with Other Legislation.Liaison with the Devolved Administrations13.42. The Act requires a Minister of the Crown to consult Welsh Ministers before making any legislation, issuing any guidance, issuing any direction or bringingany proceedings in relation to a Category 1 or 2 responder in Wales.15 The Actalso requires a Minister of the Crown to obtain the consent of Welsh Ministers

before undertaking such action in relation to a Category 1 or 2 responder which has functions that are devolved.16
13.4313.44.13.45.
The Act requires a Minister of the Crown to consult the Scottish Ministers when making legislation in relation to Category 1 or 2 responders in Scotland.The Act requires a Minister of the Crown to consult the Northern Ireland Department of Justice when making regulations or an order in relation to the PSNI. A Minister of the Crown may only make regulations in relation to the non-devolved functions of the PSNI. Where the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland proposes to make regulations or an order in relation to the devolved functions of the PSNI, the Act requires that it consult a Minister of the Crown.Ministers of the Crown will consult the Devolved Administrations when considering monitoring and enforcement action.

Chapter 14 (The Role of the Voluntary Sector) ofEmergency Preparedness, Revised VersionSummaryï The voluntary sector has an important role to play in supporting the statutory services in the planning, response and recovery phases of most emergencies (paragraph 14.1).ï Category 1 responders who include the voluntary sector in their local planning arrangements will make the overall response more accessible and effective throughout the community. This is not just good practice: the Regulations require Category 1 responders to have regard to the contribution of the voluntary sector. This includes considering how the voluntary sector can be involved at every stage, including training and exercising to respond to emergencies (paragraphs 14.4-14.8).ï There are four models suggested for Category 1 responders to follow when engaging the voluntary sector effectively in order to discharge their duties at the local level (paragraphs 14.11-14.15).ï Responders should be aware of the extent and range of services the voluntary sector can offer before making plans to involve them (paragraphs 14.16-14.18).ï It is essential that volunteers from the voluntary sector are trained and that they are supported by the responding organisations they are helping (paragraphs 14.24-14.26).ï The way Category 1 and 2 responders work with the voluntary sector at the local level is supported by consistent arrangements at other levels (paragraphs 14.27-14.30).ï 
 WHAT THE ACT AND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE 14.1. In some circumstances, emergencies can overstretch the resources of the emergency services, local authorities and other local responders during the response and recovery phases of an emergency. The value of involving the voluntary sector at every stage in order to provide additional support has been demonstrated on many occasions. The delivery of their services, and their role as a link between communities and Category 1 responders, may also enable them to support the development of community resilience activities.14.2. The voluntary sector in the United Kingdom is very large and diverse. The skills and expertise available from the voluntary sector vary from place to place. Experience shows that advance planning enables voluntary sector activity to be more integrated and effective.14.3. The Regulations require Category 1 responders to have regard to the activities of certain voluntary organisations in the course of carrying out their emergencyand business continuity planning duties.1  Category 1 responders must haveregard to those voluntary sector bodies which carry out activities in the geographical area 2 for which the responder is responsible. Further explanation of the term ‘have regard to’ can be found in paragraphs 14.5 and 14.6.14.4. Voluntary sector organisations are those bodies whose activities are carried out not for profit and which are not public authorities or local authorities. Under the Regulations, they become relevant voluntary organisations if they carry on any activities for the purpose of preventing emergencies, reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of emergencies, or taking other action in connection with emergencies.3 This is a broad definition that will capture charities and other voluntary organisations.14.1.

PAGE 3
14.5. This does not mean that Category 1 responders should work only with those voluntary sector organisations established solely for the purpose of working in the field of civil protection. Few voluntary sector bodies are established for the sole purpose of responding to emergencies. Most will have a partial interest tangential to their main business, for example, this may include faith organisations. Nevertheless, these voluntary sector organisations must be factored into local civil protection arrangements where they may have a contribution to make or a role to play in planning for, or responding to, or recovery from, an emergency.14.6. This obligation is intended to ensure that Category 1 responders actively consider and engage the voluntary sector during the planning process, rather than at the end or not at all. As such, simply sending copies of plans to voluntary organisations is not sufficient, nor is including voluntary organisations in plans without consulting them. Instead, Category 1 responders must consider and discuss with relevant voluntary organisations, the capabilities that those organisations within their area have to offer, and whether those capabilities should be built into response and recovery plans. Agreements reached should be captured in plans and signed off by all affected parties.14.7. The requirement to have regard to the activities of relevant voluntary sector organisations covers both emergency plans and business continuity plans (BCPs). In the case of the former, voluntary sector capabilities such as search and rescue or humanitarian support may be built into the response arrangements agreed between the statutory services. In the case of the latter, the voluntary sector may, in the course of everyday business, already deliver certain services on behalf of a statutory provider that would need to be maintained (such as ‘meals on wheels’). In addition, certain BCPs may use voluntary organisations to backfill functions that would be undermined by the diversion of resources to deal with the direct consequences of an emergency or major incident. For example, with14.1. 
ambulances diverted to the scene of a large emergency, an ambulance trust might have an agreement with the local St John Ambulance (paragraph 14.17) for the organisation to carry out routine patient collection. However, responders should be aware that the voluntary sector may need more support during a sustained response. This should be considered when planning for longer term responses such as swine flu.
14.8. 14.9. 4 s. 4
The Act also requires local authorities to provide business continuity advice to those voluntary sector bodies which it considers to be appropriate.4 Advice on how to discharge this requirement is set out in Chapter 8. Nevertheless, local authorities may find it useful to consider how their engagement of the voluntary sector in the planning process might dovetail with work to meet that specific requirement.Engaging the voluntary sector at the local levelBy establishing the appropriate organisational framework, the voluntary sector can be properly factored into the planning process. This will ensure that the voluntary sector have the capability to carry out duties and are not used to replace statutory authorities and statutorily funded capabilities. Sound co-operation through
the Local Resilience Forum (LRF) processes and directly with individual Category 1 responders should be based on an agreed framework. This structure needs to suit local circumstances, be understood by all concerned and have clearly identified points of contact. These contact arrangements must be kept up to date by regular formal and informal dialogue between each of the participants at local level.14.10. There are several different models that can be applied at the local level. None is mandatory, but these models, either individually or in combination, can help Category 1 responders to discharge their duties under the Act.Model 1: Engagement through the LRF14.11. At the local level, each LRF should consider including a voluntary sector representative. The representative should be able to speak on behalf of all the major voluntary organisations operating in the area, as well as any smaller, local voluntary organisations.Model 2: Establishing a voluntary sector subgroup of the LRF14.12. Setting up a voluntary sector co-ordinating group at local level can help co- operation between the statutory services and local voluntary organisations. A representative from the local authority civil contingencies team will normally chair such a group. The group can bring together representatives from the voluntary sector organisations with an interest in civil protection which are active in the LRF area. The principal advantage of such a group is that it should enable all Category 1 responders to have a good understanding of the strengths and limitations of local voluntary sector organisations, and to consider including them in their planning to an extent that is realistic.14.1. 
Model 3: Bilateral links on the basis of functions14.13. One method of involving voluntary organisations in civil contingency planning is to group them where appropriate on the basis of their functions, and link them with the Category 1 responder responsible for those functions. This functional grouping can clarify the contributions which individual voluntary organisations can make. It can prevent duplicated demands on their services and enable Category 1 responders and voluntary organisations to make the best use of the voluntary contribution. Voluntary organisations can also be involved in functional planning and response matters by giving them representation at working groups associated with LRFs and wider groupings.14.14. In some cases, there will be one Category 1 responder and one voluntary organisation linked to a specific function, for example, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). In other cases, where a voluntary organisation performs a range of functions, it would need to be associated with more than one Category 1 responder and represented on all the relevant functional groups. In all cases, local civil protection personnel should be fully aware of the level of voluntary sector support available and the arrangements for its provision in a co-ordinated manner.Model 4: Bilateral links on the basis of capabilities14.15. A related method is to distinguish between the operational role of voluntary organisations when they directly help in the response to an emergency, and their support role, for example when they provide refreshments for the emergency services. An LRF-level multi-agency plan should list which services are offered across the range of voluntary organisations. A key principle of the plan is to avoid double-counting by indicating which Category 1 responder has first call on (or priority need for) any particular voluntary contribution and to define a co-ordinated call-out system.14.1. 
Box 14.1 Lincolnshire case study on co-ordinating the voluntary response (including ‘convergent volunteers’) during emergenciesToplan forthepotentialresource challenges ofcoastal flooding, emergency planners needed a clear understanding of the capability and capacity of the voluntary sector to help statutory agencies respond and recover during a large scale, wide area and prolonged emergency.A two-day conference was held for the voluntary sector, which included discussions around a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and its implications. The conference also provided an opportunity to invite larger voluntary sector organisations to assist with joint training initiatives and, for example, assure the ability of the British Red Cross (BRC) to operate at the levels required.The voluntary sector was promoted in a positive and helpful way, increasing senior managers’ and emergency responders’ awareness and understanding of their capability. Voluntary sector organisations appreciated the fact that their contributions were valued and respected. The conference led to the formal development of a collectively agreed MOU in Lincolnshire, allowing:ï co-ordination of the voluntary sector response in the county on behalfof the LRF (including convergent volunteers) by British Red Cross;ï voluntary sector representatives to work alongside the unified rescue cell as part of the command support functions that are established during an emergency response;ï assessment of volunteer and convergent volunteer capabilities;ï identification of a focal point for LRF requests for deployment; andï 

Individual voluntary sector organisations are then brought into the detail of planning through bilateral relationships with Category 1 responders on the basis of their capabilities and functions, ensuring full interconnectedness between the voluntary and statutory sectors. Voluntary sector organisations also take part in some other LRF subgroups, are offered training and take part in exercises.“By establishing a voluntary sector subgroup of the LRF, we ensure that the statutory responders have access to a clear picture of the voluntary sector’s capabilities in Derbyshire.”Ian Shuttleworth, Chief Emergency Planning Officer, Derbyshire.“The statutory services in Derbyshire have adopted a flexible but well-organised approach to our voluntary sector involvement. This careful engagement at the planning phase has proven its worth in the response phase, and we have successfully supported the statutory services when emergencies have stretched their resources.” Moya Wood-Heath, Chair - Voluntary Sector Civil Protection Forum14.16. Capabilities of the voluntary sectorThose preparing emergency plans should be aware of the extent and range of operational and support activities and services provided by the voluntary sector at all stages, from planning through to the response and recovery phases of emergencies in the United Kingdom.o There are established organisations such as the British Red Cross, WRVS, Salvation Army, St John Ambulance (or St Andrew’sFirst Aid in Scotland) that provide a range of services and activities;
o Many individual volunteers have particular skills, but arenot necessarily members of recognised voluntary organisations: for example interpreters or representatives from the faith communities.o Certain organisations contribute specialist skills in various types of activity:ï search and rescue organisations, such as the British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC), coastguard response teams (HM Coastguard’s Auxiliary branch), the Mountain Rescue Council (MRC), the RNLI, the International Rescue Corps (IRC),Sky Watch, search and rescue dog teams;ï groups of doctors, such as the British Association forImmediate Care Schemes (BASICS);ï in London, the London Air Ambulance provides an emergency service;ï voluntary radio operators, such as the RadioAmateurs’ Emergency Network (RAYNET);ï Organisations which specialise in providing emotional support and counselling, such as Cruse Bereavement Care, the Samaritans and Victim Support; andï other non-governmental organisations (NGOs).14.17. The voluntary sector can provide support at every stage of emergency planning, response and recovery in a number of generic areas:o practical support and welfare;o social and psychological aftercare;o medical support, properties and essential supplies;o search and rescue;o transport;o communications;o documentation;o 
o training and exercising; ando signposting to other organisations.
14.18. 14.19. 14.20. 14.21. 
Annex 14A sets out examples of the extent and range of support activities and services that volunteers can provide and of the statutory organisations with which they frequently work.It is important to be precise on the accountability of volunteers to a professional agency because of issues of legal liability, including statutory requirements under the Children Act 2004, and because of insurance indemnity issues. Agencies working with voluntary sector organisations will need to consider the health and safety of volunteers. They may wish to use a Service Level Agreement, Memorandum of Understanding or some other form of protocol to establish arrangements to identify the level of insurance cover provided by the voluntary organisations, the training provided to voluntary sector personnel, or the use of Personal Protective Equipment. Further information on establishing these protocols can be found in the Voluntary Sector Engagement Guidance Note at www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ sites/default/files/resources/engaging_voluntarysector.pdf It is of vital importance that, if an emergency occurs, the voluntary sector should be able to contribute what has been mutually agreed and written into local plans. Voluntary agencies have therefore to be able to demonstrate their capabilities and that their support is reliable, consistent and sustainable to the required standard. A record of available local voluntary resources should be maintained, where appropriate, as part of an LRF-level multi-agency plan.The statutory and voluntary sectors should be clear about their respective roles in an emergency. They each have their own structures and constraints. Voluntary
organisations must appreciate that the Category 1 responders bear the responsibility for the overall emergency response. Equally, the statutory services must develop an understanding of the voluntary sector as a rich resource for personnel, professional skills and equipment. They should also recognise that the voluntary sector may have the capability to work with local individuals who are not members of a voluntary organisation and wish to contribute to the response or recovery phases as convergent volunteers, building capacity, individual and community resilience. Individuals are likely to come forward irrespective of whether they are needed. Responders should work with voluntary agencies to formalise a process and procedure for the use of convergent volunteers.14.22. Plans should include effective procedures for alerting or calling out voluntary organisations, or putting volunteers and organisations on standby (and ensuring stand down) to ensure the optimum response. Early alert is desirable because of the lead time needed for contacting and assembling teams in organisations other than the emergency services. Contingency arrangements should reflect this. It is usually the responsibility of the voluntary sector to organise the initial call-out and briefing of volunteers such as setting out points of contact and how voluntary agency staff might liaise with volunteers and Category 1 or 2 responders. These roles should be reflected in the plans.14.23. A Memorandum of Understanding should be in place describing any bilateral or multilateral agreement between responders, including financial arrangements. For example, consideration should be given to arrangements for payment of petrol costs to 4x4 drivers in emergency situations such as heavy snow fall. There should be agreement and effective plans on the use of volunteers, the decision-making process leading to their call-out and the method of call-out. Plans should determine who will organise, manage and brief volunteers. Debriefing should be included as part of plan maintenance procedures. Planners also need to establish that volunteers receive refreshment and are appropriately clothed, identified and equipped.14.1. 
Training and exercising14.24. When considering the particular contribution that the voluntary sector can make, it should be noted that established voluntary organisations and volunteer groups will usually have their own training arrangements. They should be able to demonstrate their effectiveness to the Category 1 responders.14.25. Additionally, the Category 1 responders and voluntary agencies should aim for joint training and exercising (including involving the community/volunteers where possible). It is very important that voluntary organisations understand the management framework of the response and how they should be positioned and integrated into the response as a whole. There will be some overlap between the functions and capabilities of different voluntary organisations. Joint exercising will identify any problems, ensure plans and procedures are up to date and foster working relationships.14.26. Effective communication, planning and training between responders and the voluntary sector should aim to identify opportunities for sharing heavy workloads and providing mutual support. General issues of training and exercising are further discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.The voluntary sector at national level14.27. At the national level, the voluntary sector has developed a co-ordinated approach to planning its contribution to civil protection, and all responders should aim to fit into this framework.14.1. 
14.28. A Voluntary Sector Civil Protection Working Party and Forum have been convened by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat and the British Red Cross. The aim of the Working Party and Forum is to identify and maximise the voluntary sector contribution to UK civil protection arrangements. This includes informing and influencing policy, testing and challenging strategic and practical guidance and facilitating the exchange of information. There are currently 20 voluntary organisations with a national or UK-wide civil protection role that are members of the Forum. The Forum provides links between the voluntary sector, central government and statutory authorities. The Working Party supports the Forum.14.29. There is a further national level standing committee, the National Voluntary Aid Societies’ Emergency Committee (NVASEC). NVASEC may be used to co-ordinate the auxiliary role of the three Voluntary Aid Societies (VASs): the British Red Cross, St John Ambulance and St Andrew’s First Aid, to support military medical services in times of conflict and war.14.1. 
Annex 14AEXAMPLES OF VOLUNTARY SECTOR ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDING ORGANISATIONS.The voluntary sector has the capacity and capability to undertake the following activities and services. The volunteers should receive appropriate training that is recognised by the responding organisation seeking their support for every stage of an emergency, from planning, through response and recovery, to resilience building.Welfareo Staffing rest centres, family and friends reception centres, survivor reception centres and humanitarian assistance centreso Feedingo Provision of clothing and other essential itemso Advice on entitlements, grants, loans, claimso Resettlement of victims, evacuees, etco Support and comfortingo Providing information and adviceï Support Linesï Drop in centresin support of:o Local authority social serviceso Children Services Departmentso Local authority housing departmento Police family liaison officerso Emergency serviceso

Regular engagement with the sector/organisation is needed to build up the necessary relationships to determine if other activities could be offered.
 Chapter 15Other sectors that should be involved in Emergency PlanningRevision to Emergency PreparednessCivil Contingencies Act Enhancement ProgrammeOctober 2011
Chapter 15 (Other sectors that should be involved in Emergency Planning) of Emergency Preparedness, Revised Version15.1. A principal aim of the Act is to bring into a single statutory framework those organisations which are most likely to be involved in most emergencies (Category 1) and those likely to be heavily involved in some emergencies (Category 2). Further advice and useful information about the voluntary sector can be found in Chapter 14 of Emergency Preparedness.15.2. However, it was not appropriate to capture in the Act every organisation that may have some involvement in emergencies. For a variety of reasons, particular organisations with an important role to play - such as the armed forces, the broadcasting media and the insurance industry - have not been included in Schedule 1.15.1. 
15.3. Even so, organisations which are not required to participate under the Act should be encouraged to take part in forums and co-operate in planning arrangements wherever this is appropriate. The statutory nature of the framework is not a consideration which in itself should imply their exclusion.15.4. There are many organisations which fall into this category, including:o the armed forceso retail companies, including supermarketso the Food Standards Agencyo insurance companieso bus and road haulage companieso taxi firmso airlineso shipping companies and ferrieso media companieso private communications networks dedicated to public safety userso offshore oil and gas industryo security firmso internal drainage boardso general practitioners and chemistso the operators of other services or infrastructure that are critical to your areaThis list is not exhaustive, and organisations that are relevant to particular emergency plans but have not been referenced within this chapter, should still be included within the preparation process where appropriate.
15.5. The armed forces: Military Aid to the Civil Authorities (MACA) can be sought to support the civil authorities when they have an urgent need for help to deal with an emergency arising from a natural disaster or a major incident. However, assistance is provided on an availability basis and the armed forces cannot make a commitment that guarantees assistance to meet specific emergencies. It is therefore essential that Category 1 and 2 responders do not base plans and organise exercises on the assumption of military assistance. The Joint Regional Liaison Officer from the local Regional Brigade Headquarters will be able to give advice and should be contacted in the first instance.15.6. Retail companies, including supermarkets: Food stocks and other goods held by private retail companies are sometimes not seen as resources likely to be called upon in emergencies. However, in widespread and prolonged emergencies where shortages of foodstuffs occur, or where individuals are unable to access food supplies due to transport disruption, localised flooding, etc., Category 1 responders may turn to the private sector, such as supermarkets, for practical and logistical assistance, and some will build this into their planning arrangements. Such arrangements already exist in some cases between local authorities, supermarkets and other organisations to assist the local community if a major incident were to occur, but it is important that new links and arrangements with other Category 1 responders are established and in place before any emergency occurs to avoid further disruptions at the time. This should be arranged locally, regionally or nationally with the relevant retailers/wholesalers.  More common are agreements with wholesale firms for the provision of, for example, building materials, and the identification of suitable private sector buildings as rest centres.15.1. 
15.7. The Food Standards Agency: The (FSA) has statutory objectives ‘to protect public health from risk which may arise in connection with the consumption of food’ and ‘to otherwise protect the interests of consumers in relation to food’.  The FSA therefore has a role to play during any emergency that has the potential to affect food safety. The FSA is a UK-wide body, with its main office in London, and offices in York, Aberdeen, Cardiff and Belfast. The response to food incidents is managed by the Agency’s Incident Unit, based in London, with smaller equivalent Incident Teams based in the devolved administrations. The FSA does not have representatives at the local level; however, it will provide information and support to LRFs and may attend meetings if input to specific food safety issues is required which cannot be dealt with through correspondence.15.8. Insurance: There is a strong case for building the insurance industry into planning arrangements. Often insurance staff, such as loss adjusters, will attend at the scene of an emergency as quickly as journalists. The Association of British Insurers provides insurance information and advice to members of the public who have suffered loss or damage as a result of an emergency. They have the capability to set up an advice service close to the scene of an emergency and can provide contacts to act as liaison points with local responders.15.9. Bus companies and road haulage: Bus companies may be included in plans to assist with evacuations. Arrangements for diverting and maintaining bus services in the event of a major central area evacuation may also require planning. Accidents involving the movement of chemicals by road are a key hazard which requires specialist knowledge and equipment. The Fire and Rescue Service is greatly assisted in response to such incidents by the Chemical Industries Association.15.1. 
15.10. Taxi firms and coach companies: In some areas, and where local authority social services and NHS ambulances are unable to manage the movement of all people who may need transport in an emergency, agreements have been reached with local taxi firms to assist in the transportation of these people. It may be possible to reach similar agreements with local coach companies.15.11. Airlines: The Act brings airports into a formal arrangement as Category 2 responders 1 to co-operate with the emergency services and other Category 1 responders in preparing for emergencies. But plans for responding effectively to the needs of distressed friends and relatives at the terminal building require the co-operation, too, of airline companies. It is usual to invite their representatives to play a part in these arrangements.15.12. Shipping companies and ferries: As with airports, harbour authorities are included as Category 2 responders under the Act.2 Planning for emergencies at sea and in ports is likely to include the main shipping and ferry companies, which are not covered by the Act.15.13. Media companies: Media companies are not included in the Act, partly because it is accepted that their independence as reporting organisations should not be compromised. However, they have a key role in providing information to the public and are likely to be heavily involved in communications planning, which is dealt with in Chapter 7.1 Schedule 1 paragraph 26.2 Schedule 1 paragraph 27.
15.14. Private communications networks dedicated to public safety users: The emergency services and other public safety agencies may rely upon private communications networks that are not listed as Category 2 responders in order to carry out their duties. These organisations will want to ensure that the relevant communications providers are included in multi-agency planning for incidents.15.15. Offshore oil and gas industry: The Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Health and Safety Executive work closely with these companies and will want to ensure that they are included in multi-agency planning for incidents at sea or at oil and gas terminals. They will also be involved in planning for fuel shortages.15.16. Security firms: Security firms have staff protecting premises of all types who are contactable by the police and may be useful during emergencies. They have a particular role in evacuations from shopping centres and sports grounds.15.17. Internal drainage boards: Internal drainage boards have powers to undertake works on defined watercourses within their geographical area. These may include operating pumps and other structures to alleviate the effects of flooding. They may be involved in the response to an emergency and should be included, where relevant, in emergency plans.15.18. General practitioners 3 and chemists: General practitioners may be called to the scene of an emergency to provide direct medical assistance or to certify deaths. Access to medication and medical services may be required for people displaced by an incident. In addition, during periods of disruption, such as severe weather, access for the public to general practitioners and chemists may be required. Considerations such as these need to be included in Category 1 responders’ planning arrangements.3 The role of General Practitioners may change with NHS Reforms
15.19. Private sector representative bodies: In addition to central and local Government, private sector representative bodies such as Confederation of British Industry, Federation of Small Businesses, British Chambers of Commerce, Business Continuity Institute, Emergency Planning Society as well as sector-specific representative bodies such as the Association of Train Operating Companies, British Retail Consortium, Food and Drink Federation, Food Storage and Distribution Federation, British Hospitality Association, Institute of Grocery Distribution and the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, Water UK and energy sector equivalent, can be helpful in providing information and advice to members of the business community on economic recovery, following loss or damage as the result of an emergency. They can also provide advice on business continuity planning, further details of which can be found on their websites, and also in chapters 6 and 8 of Emergency Preparedness.15.20. Private Veterinary Surgeons: Private vets may be called to the scene of an accident or emergency to provide emergency veterinary assistance to relieve pain and suffering and to protect animal welfare. Access to veterinary care may also be required for companion animals displaced, along with their owners, by an incident. Considerations such as these, including any necessary contractual arrangements, need to be included in Category 1 responders’ planning arrangements. Private vets, appointed as Official Veterinarians, may also be called on to assist Government vets in responding to large-scale exotic disease outbreaks. Category 1 responders should also consider the need for training for veterinarians who may be called upon to assist in large animal rescues. This would enhance the effectiveness of joint working as illustrated in the national Incident Command protocols and national animal rescue guidelines. Details of the training, which is available from providers recognised by the Chief Fire Officers Association National Animal Rescue Practitioners Forum (CFOA ARPF), can be obtained from, and in some cases through, the Fire and Rescue Service. This training is endorsed by the RSPCA and veterinary associations, namely the British Equine Veterinary Association and British Cattle Veterinary Association.15.1. 
15.21. Other sectors that may be considered within the emergency planning process are:o accommodation facilities, such as hotels, bed and breakfast services and student residenceso motor assistance companieso conference/leisure centre facilities which could provide short term sheltero

Chapter 16 (Collaboration and Co-operation between Local Resilience Forums in England) of Emergency Preparedness
16.1. The United Kingdom’s approach to civil contingencies is based on the principle of subsidiarity; the principle by which decisions should be taken at the lowest appropriate level with co-ordination at the highest necessary level.16.2. Local Resilience Forums are the building block for emergency planning activities with Strategic and Recovery Co-ordinating Groups acting as the local mechanisms which are engaged during the response and recovery phases of emergencies.Opportunities to collaborate and co-operate at a multi- LRF Level16.3. Planning for, and responding to, large-scale emergencies cannot be done in isolation in each LRF. Mechanisms for cross-boundary working and relationship building are essential as some emergencies will overwhelm localities’ resources and/or boundaries.16.4. Collaboration and co-operation between localities in England is a well-established and critical way of working in civil contingencies. It is a mechanism:o for enabling pooling of resources to achieve agreed mutual aims and outcomes;o for avoiding duplication of work between neighbouring LRFs or avoiding activity by an LRF that may be counter-productive to a neighbouring LRF;o to support planning and exercising for emergencies that cross local resilience areas or which could overwhelm a locality; ando that enables individual responders, local forums and centralgovernment to work together to address large-scale civil protection issues.
16.5. Cross locality working is undertaken on a permissive basis and neither civil protection legislation nor guidance seeks to impose structures on local areas or limit how they choose to collaborate and co-operate. LRFs are free to create flexible multi-LRF mechanisms and processes to best suit their risks and needs.16.6. In some circumstances, it might be more efficient for national organisations and those organisations which operate across local boundaries (such as utilities companies, transport operators, and government agencies) to share information using multi-LRF groupings. Indeed, some of these organisations will struggle to find the resources to duplicate work at the single LRF level. For further guidance Chapter 2: Co-operation and Chapter 3: Formal information sharing are available at: http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/emergency-preparedness16.7. Regional Resilience Forums formerly provided a uniform system for LRF collaboration within that region. There is no continuing requirement to work on regional boundaries, and responders may now replace these regional forums with more flexible structures for multi-LRF working.16.8. A range of different geographically based multi-forum groupings are possible. These include Civil Protection Forums, LRF Secretariat /LRF Chair Forums and multi-responder strategic alliances incorporating health and local authority partners. These forums may cover varying geographical areas and may encompass, for example, working with the Devolved Administrations. Responders may also retain existing groups on previous geographical boundaries such as the Media Emergency Forum, Mass Fatalities Groups, Capabilities, Risk and Working Groups, or establish other suitable mechanisms to enable cross-locality collaboration and co-operation. Other theme based multi-LRF groupings have been established to allow joint planning around shared risks such as East Coast and Reservoir Flood Planning groups. The national resilience extranet (NRE) is a source of information and case studies about multi-LRF groups.16.1. 
16.9. Local responders should decide whether to maintain any former regional plans such as a generic response plan. Responders and LRFs are encouraged to put in place arrangements and plans that suit local needs, and to conserve, utilise and build on the good practice that is contained in any existing plans.Government support for multi-LRF collaboration and co-operation16.10. The DCLG Resilience and Emergencies Division (RED) works directly with LRFs, supporting collaboration and co-operation in planning for wide-area high- impact events affecting more than one locality. RED has allocated Resilience Advisers to each LRF so that LRFs have named contacts with which to build working relationships. Resilience Advisers support and challenge the LRF in a constructive, proportionate manner through:o simplifying and reducing duplication of central government interaction with local responders;o facilitating the co-operation and sharing of information between responders and LRFs to ensure risks are fully understood (e.g. implementation of the National Emergency Plan for Fuel);o identifying good practice and facilitating its sharing;o facilitating opportunities for peer reviews;o actively participating in training and exercising alongside LRFs, when appropriate, i.e. for wide area or high impact incidents where Government is part of the response machinery; ando facilitating discussions around mutual aid arrangementso 
More information on RED’s role and the contact details for resilience advisors are available on the national resilience extranet (NRE).16.11. Support for LRF collaboration is a key part of the RED adviser role. Successful cross locality working enables responders and local resilience forums to manage large-scale emergencies, and partners involved must have effective working relationships based on good communication, and effective, efficient information sharing. This will enable them to assess and agree who is best placed to address an issue. (see para 2.3)16.12. DCLG RED plays an active part in increasing resilience: supporting preparedness enhancement and providing assurance to central government that the necessary capabilities are in place at the local level to meet national planning requirements.16.13. Resilience Advisers within DCLG RED have been allocated liaison roles for each of the work streams in the National Resilience Capabilities Programme. RED will liaise with Lead Government Departments; LRFs and other relevant emergency responder organisations on current and planned LRF and multi-LRF capabilities.16.14. RED’s ability to engage with LRFs and, in particular, hold dialogue with multiple- LRFs, complements the existing governance and information sharing arrangements in place between work stream lead Departments and local responders. This is achieved by:o access and insights into the national capability requirements;o the ability to provide a richer picture of capabilities on the ground; ando facilitation and promotion of cross-boundary working between LRFs.For further details on the National Resilience Capabilities Programme, see Chapters 4 and 13 and http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/capabilities-programme
